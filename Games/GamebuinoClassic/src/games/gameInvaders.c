// Invaders (Yoda Zhang / "yodasvideoarcade", License: None specified -
// yodasvideoarcade.com/gamebuino.php). A real Space Invaders clone: move
// the ship left/right, shoot the descending invader grid before it reaches
// the bottom, a UFO saucer occasionally flies across the top for bonus
// points, and 4 bunkers erode as they're hit by either side's shots.
// Upstream ships as 6 real `.ino` tabs sharing one translation unit
// (invaders/standard/specific/nonstandard/images/sounds) - all 6 were read
// in full before writing this port.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why -
// this dialect has no classes/methods). `gb.display.cursorX =`/
// `cursorY =` ported unchanged (plain globals here too). `random(2)` became
// `arand(2)` (this dialect's own established RNG helper). `gb.pickRandom
// Seed()` became `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a documented no-op. `gb.battery.
// show=false;` was dropped outright - purely cosmetic on real hardware,
// matching every other port's own treatment of the same call. Upstream's
// own `String gamestatus` (compared with `==` against `"title"`/
// `"running"`/etc, real Arduino String objects with real heap churn every
// tick) became a plain `int invState` compared against `InvState` enum
// constants - the same "flatten a real single-instance library into plain
// C globals/functions" treatment this whole project uses, just applied to
// a state variable instead of a class instance this time.
//
// `gb.setFrameRate(30)` is a GENUINE explicit upstream call (unlike Pong's
// own missing call, which turned out to be a real bug in that port's own
// history - see this project's own CLAUDE.md) - ported literally as
// `gbSetFrameRate(30)`, a real, intentionally-chosen 30fps rate, not
// something needing correction.
//
// STATE MACHINE - upstream's own real `loop()` shape, preserved exactly:
// `if (gamestatus=="newgame"){newgame();}` / `if (gamestatus=="newlevel")
// {newlevel();}` / `if (gamestatus=="running"){...}` / `if (gamestatus==
// "title"){showtitle();}` / `if (gamestatus=="gameover"){...}` are FIVE
// SEPARATE consecutive `if` statements upstream, not an if/else-if chain -
// meaning pressing A on the title screen falls through newgame->newlevel->
// running ALL WITHIN THE SAME real tick (newgame() sets gamestatus=
// "newlevel", which the very next `if` immediately notices and acts on,
// same for newlevel()->"running"), so a fresh game's very first frame is
// already a fully-drawn, playing level - no blank setup frames. Likewise a
// GAMEOVER transition triggered mid-tick by invInvaderLogic()/
// invHandleDeath() (partway through the running block) is immediately
// noticed by the gameover check later in that SAME chain, so the "GAME
// OVER" box appears on the very same tick a game genuinely ends. Ported
// here as five separate `if` statements in `gameInvaders_update()` in the
// same order, specifically NOT else-if, to reproduce this real same-tick
// fallthrough behavior exactly - not an oversight.
//
// A GENUINE DELIBERATE DEVIATION, clearly bounded: upstream's own
// `checkbuttons()` (called first inside the running block) can itself call
// the real BLOCKING `gb.titleScreen(...)` on a Button-C press, which
// freezes real hardware inside its own internal update loop for as many
// real frames as it takes the player to press A again - only once THAT
// call finally returns does the rest of the running block's own remaining
// draw calls (drawplayership() etc) execute, painting one more gameplay
// frame directly on top of the splash's own last-drawn pixels before the
// NEXT real tick finally flips to the "title" scoreboard screen (since the
// buffer is only cleared once per real gb.update() cycle, and the
// blocking call's own internal loop already consumed a whole one on its
// last iteration). The net effect on real hardware is one harmless,
// literally-unobservable-at-20fps glitch frame. Rather than reproduce that
// buffer-overlap artifact bit-for-bit, `invCheckButtons()`'s own C-press
// branch here just sets `invState = INV_STATE_SPLASH` and `invUpdateRunning
// ()` returns immediately right after calling it if state is no longer
// RUNNING - matching the clean "blocking loop -> explicit resumable state"
// treatment gamePong.c/gameSimonbuino.c/every other port here already
// uses for the exact same real gb.titleScreen()-mid-play pattern. This
// early return is added ONLY for this one case (a genuine real BLOCKING
// call upstream) - it is deliberately NOT added after the mid-sequence
// GAMEOVER transitions above, since those are just plain variable
// assignments on real hardware (not blocking calls), so the rest of that
// tick's own drawing genuinely does keep running past them there, exactly
// like upstream.
//
// SPLASH SCREEN (real `gb.titleScreen(name, gamelogo)`, called at boot,
// again on a mid-game Button-C press, and a third time from the custom
// "title" scoreboard screen's own Button-C press) - reproduces the real
// `Gamebuino::titleScreen()` source's own actual logo placement, read
// directly from the real library (`more games/Gamebuino-Classic/
// Gamebuino.cpp`): the passed name string prints at cursor (0,12), then
// the passed logo bitmap draws at `(0, 12+logoOffset)` where `logoOffset`
// is the active font's own real `fontHeight` if the name string is
// non-empty, else 0. This game's default font is never changed from real
// hardware's own default (font3x5, fontHeight=6) anywhere in the real
// source, and all 3 real call sites pass a non-empty name - so the offset
// is always a constant 6, landing the logo at a fixed `(0, 18)`, computed
// once here rather than re-derived at runtime. The real function's own
// blinking A-button-icon hint, B-button mute-toggle readout, and C-button
// "flash the SD-card loader" gesture are all dropped, matching this
// project's own established simplification for every other ported
// `titleScreen()` recreation (see gameSimonbuino.c/gameFlappyBirdo.c) - no
// extra "PRESS A" stand-in text was added here either, since (unlike
// those two games) this game's own real name string already occupies the
// equivalent line.
//
// A PRESERVED REAL UPSTREAM INCONSISTENCY: two of the three real
// `gb.titleScreen(...)` call sites (`setup()`, and the Button-C handler
// inside the RUNNING state's own `checkbuttons()`) pass `"    Yoda's"`
// (4 leading spaces); the third (the scoreboard "title" screen's own
// Button-C handler) passes plain `"Yoda's"` with none - almost certainly
// an unintentional inconsistency in the original source rather than
// meaningful design, but real hardware genuinely would show this exact
// difference, so it's preserved via an `invSplashIndented` flag set by
// whichever of the 3 call sites triggers the splash, rather than silently
// unifying the two texts.
//
// A SHARED-VARIABLE QUIRK, PRESERVED BY CALL ORDER: `invadershotframe`
// (real `invInvaderShotFrame` here) is BOTH the invader-bomb sprite's own
// blink-animation frame counter AND the player ship's own death-flash
// frame selector (`playership[1+invadershotframe]`) - the same variable,
// reused for two unrelated sprites. Upstream's own real `loop()` reads it
// for the death flash (`drawplayership()`) BEFORE updating it for the bomb
// animation (`invadershot()`, later in the same tick) - so the death flash
// always shows the PREVIOUS tick's toggle value. Reproduced automatically
// here just by calling `invDrawPlayerShip()` before `invInvaderShot()` in
// the exact same order inside `invUpdateRunning()`, with no special-casing
// needed.
//
// A PRESERVED POTENTIAL DOUBLE-COLLISION QUIRK: `invInvaderShot()`'s own
// per-shot loop checks bunker collision, then player-ship collision, then
// player-shot collision, unconditionally in sequence with no `continue`/
// early-exit after a shot is consumed by an earlier check in that same
// pass (upstream never added one either) - so in the narrow edge case
// where a consumed shot's reset position (`-1`, `-1`) coincidentally still
// satisfies a LATER check's own box test in the same iteration (e.g. the
// player-ship check when `shipx==0`, making its own box include x=0), a
// single real shot could theoretically be double-processed within one
// tick. Preserved exactly as upstream wrote it, matching this project's
// own "preserve real upstream behavior/bugs by default" norm - the window
// is narrow enough it was very likely never once observed on real
// hardware either.
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED. Every real `const byte PROGMEM NAME[] = {...}`
// array in `images.ino` (gamelogo, invader[8], playership[3], bunker[5],
// bomb[2], saucer[2]) was decoded via a small one-off Python script reading
// the real `.ino` source directly, converting every `B00000000`-style
// Arduino binary literal to a plain int and re-rendering each frame's own
// bits back into an ASCII preview to confirm the conversion against the
// expected sprite shapes before trusting it (same verification discipline
// as gameFlappyBirdo.c's own restoration pass) - not hand-transcribed.
// Every real PROGMEM byte became one plain `int` cell in a
// `int[N] name = { width, height, byte0, byte1, ... }` array (this
// dialect's own `int[N] name` array-declaration order, not C's
// `int name[N]`), exactly the shape `gbDrawBitmap()` expects.
// CHECKED FOR THE FILL/MASK-UNDERNEATH BUG CLASS (found twice in
// gameFlappyBirdo.c this project's own history): every real
// `gb.display.drawBitmap(...)` call site in this game's own source was
// checked directly, and NONE of them are preceded by a `setColor(GRAY)`/
// mask-bitmap pass or a plain `fillRect()` - every sprite here (invaders,
// ship, bunkers, bombs, saucer) is a single, self-contained `drawBitmap()`
// call straight onto the plain white background. The only real
// `setColor(0)`+`fillRect()` pair in this whole game is `showgameover()`'s
// own opaque white text-box backing (a UI box, not a sprite) - ported
// verbatim in `invShowGameOver()`.
//
// BITMAP FRAME SELECTION: upstream indexes each sprite's own real 2D
// PROGMEM array with a single flat index (`invader[invaders[i]+
// invaderframe[i]]` picks one of 8 rows this way; `playership[1+
// invadershotframe]`, `bunker[bunkers[i]]`, `bomb[frame]`, and
// `saucer[saucers]` all do the same over their own smaller arrays). Ported
// here as small `invDrawXBitmap(x, y, idx)` if/else-chain helpers
// selecting among separately-declared named 1D arrays (`invBmpInvader0`..
// `7` etc), rather than declaring one real 2D array and passing a single-
// indexed row (which decays to a pointer) straight into `gbDrawBitmap()`.
// The latter isn't known to fail here - gameSimonbuino.c's own
// `simonSoundFx[fx][i]` proves 2D-array element reads work fine in this
// dialect - but passing a 2D array's own inner row specifically as a
// decayed `int*` bitmap pointer into `gbDrawBitmap()` has no proven
// precedent anywhere in this codebase, and this project's own established
// convention (see the `switch`-statement avoidance elsewhere in this file
// and throughout the project) is to not be the first port to gamble on an
// unproven construct when an already-proven one (if/else over named 1D
// arrays, used by every other ported game's own bitmap-frame-selection
// code) does the same job.
//
// `invInvaderX`/`Y`/`Invaders`/`InvaderFrame` are sized `[40]` here, not
// upstream's own declared `[55]` - real dead headroom, confirmed directly:
// nothing in any of the 6 real upstream files ever indexes past 39.
//
// `invInvaderLogic()`'s own real `do { ... } while (invaders[ctr]==-1);`
// (advance the invader-cycle index, wrapping and reversing direction past
// 39, skipping already-dead slots) was rewritten as a plain `while` loop
// with an explicit `found` flag instead - not because `do/while` is known
// to fail here, simply because it's untested in this codebase, matching
// this project's own general policy of preferring an already-proven
// looping construct (`while`, used elsewhere in this project) over an
// unproven one when the rewrite is this mechanical.
//
// SOUND: `soundfx[8][8]` copied verbatim into `invSoundFx` (matching
// gameSimonbuino.c's own `simonSoundFx[5][8]` precedent for a 2D sound-
// parameter table; all 8 rows/8 columns re-verified byte-for-byte against
// sounds.ino). Real `playsoundfx(fxno, channel)` builds a small per-channel
// FX-synth preset each call (`gb.sound.command(...)` for waveform/
// instrument, volume slide, pitch/arpeggio slide, then `playNote()`) -
// `invPlaySfx()` is now a real, faithful port of this via this shim's own
// `gbSoundCommand()`/`gbPlayNoteChannel()` primitives (a direct port of
// real Sound.h's own per-channel tracker commands). All 6 real
// `playsoundfx()` call sites already passed the same real channel number
// upstream itself uses at that exact site (0/1/2), so no call site needed
// to change.
//
// The digit-count cursor-offset formula upstream uses twice (`14-2*
// (score>9)-2*(score>99)-2*(score>999)`, relying on C++'s own implicit
// bool-to-int promotion under multiplication) was rewritten here as a
// small `invDigitCount()` helper instead of a literal port - not because
// this dialect's own `bool` (confirmed 1/0-valued) is known to reject that
// arithmetic, simply because no other file in this project has yet tested
// multiplying a bool by an int, and the helper is exactly as short while
// only relying on already-proven `if`/`return` arithmetic.
//
// Upstream never calls `gb.display.setFont(...)` anywhere in any of its 6
// files - real hardware's own default font (font3x5) is used for every
// screen this game ever draws, unchanged for the whole game. This port
// therefore never calls `gbSetFont()` either (gbBegin() already selects
// `gbFont3x5` by default) - every real cursor-position/text layout number
// upstream uses ported completely unchanged, with no narrower/rescaled
// substitute font needed at all (unlike several earlier ports in this
// project, made before real fonts existed here).
//
// EEPROM PERSISTENCE ADDED, BEYOND REAL UPSTREAM - no `EEPROM.read()`/
// `EEPROM.write()` calls exist anywhere in this game's real source, so
// `invHighscore` was originally genuine in-session-only state, explicitly
// reset to 0 by upstream's own real `setup()` every single launch. Added
// directly on request once an audit found this game displays a real
// highscore that never survives a cartridge reboot: `gameInvaders_init()`'s
// own real `invHighscore = 0;` line is now a real `eeprom_read_word(0)`
// load instead (with the same `==0xFFFF` fresh-EEPROM-cell reset check
// already established elsewhere in this project, e.g. gameCrabator.c/
// gameDescent.c, rather than trusting a raw 65535 sentinel) - the very
// same effective "0 on a genuinely fresh card" outcome upstream's own
// hardcoded `=0` produced, just no longer discarding a real earlier save.
// Saved via `eeprom_write_word(0, invHighscore)` at the exact point
// upstream's own real highscore-tracking line already updates it in
// memory - a one-shot write per new high score, not a per-frame write.
