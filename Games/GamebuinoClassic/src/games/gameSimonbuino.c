// Simonbuino v2 (Jerom / Forklift5, license: None specified -
// github.com/Forklift5/Simonbuino). A Simon-says memory game for Gamebuino
// Classic: the console plays a growing sequence of 4 tones (mapped to
// Up/Right/Down/Left), the player must repeat it back exactly; get it right
// and the sequence grows by one more note, get it wrong and the game shows
// a brief fail flash before returning to the title screen. Sound FX credited
// upstream to "FX Synth by yodasvideoarcade".
//
// Upstream is a real multi-tab Arduino sketch (Simonbuino.ino/Buttons.ino/
// Melody.ino/Player.ino/Sound.ino) - the Arduino IDE concatenates every .ino
// tab in a sketch folder into one translation unit before compiling, so
// this was always genuinely one program across 5 files, not 5 separate
// pieces - consolidated here into this one source file accordingly, in the
// same spirit as gamePong.c/gameAgaruino.c's own single-file ports. Every
// upstream global/function got a `simon`-prefixed name (this dialect's
// cartridge has no linker - every game shares one flat global namespace -
// see this project's own gamebuinoShim.h header comment) rather than
// upstream's own generic tab-derived names (`Buttons`/`Player`/`Sound`/
// `Melody` are exactly the kind of name a future game could collide with).
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why -
// this dialect has no classes/methods). `random(N)` became `arand(N)`.
// `byte` became plain `int` (this dialect's own avrCompat.h aliasing).
//
// One real simplification remains beyond the usual mechanical rewrite (a
// second, dropped bitmap art, was later restored once this shim grew a real
// bitmap blitter - see the dedicated paragraph on that below the list; a
// third, the "FX Synth" `Sound::command()` effects, was later restored too
// once this shim grew a real tracker/pattern sound engine - see
// `simonPlaySoundFx()`'s own comment below):
//
// 1. **`gb.titleScreen()`'s own real blocking-call shape.** Upstream's own
//    `initGame()` opens with a blocking `gb.titleScreen(titleBitmap)` call,
//    and only *after* that call returns (i.e. only once a real A-press
//    dismisses it) does the rest of `initGame()` run: reseeding
//    `melody[]`, and resetting every round variable. `initGame()` itself is
//    called from 3 places - real cartridge boot, a manual Button-C press
//    (`key_reset()`), and a failed round timing out (`player_fail()`) - so
//    on real hardware, *every one* of those events shows the title screen
//    again and needs a fresh A-press before a new sequence actually starts.
//    Ported as an explicit `SIMON_STATE_TITLE`/`SIMON_STATE_PLAY` state
//    machine (matching gamePong.c's own titleScreen-to-state-machine
//    treatment): `simonBeginTitle()` only switches state (mirroring the
//    blocking call itself), and the actual melody-reseed-plus-var-reset
//    logic lives in `simonBeginPlay()`, run only once, on the exact A-press
//    that dismisses the title - exactly mirroring upstream's own "reset
//    happens after titleScreen() returns" ordering. All 3 real reset call
//    sites (boot / Button C / fail-timeout) call `simonBeginTitle()` here.
//
// **Real bitmap art restored.** Upstream drew its entire play screen
// (title logo, background frame, all 4 direction-pad graphics, and the
// "CONGRATULATIONS!!" smiley screen) from real PROGMEM bitmap arrays via
// `gb.display.drawBitmap(x, y, bmp[, rotation, flip])` - when this file was
// first written, this shim had no `gbDrawBitmap()`/`gbDrawBitmapRotated()`
// at all, so every bitmap was dropped for plain-primitive stand-ins (title/
// win text, 4 outlined rectangles for the pads). Now that both primitives
// exist (ported bit-for-bit from the real Display.cpp, including its own
// real rotation/flip quirks - see gamebuinoShim.h's own header comment on
// `gbDrawBitmapRotated`), every real bitmap has been restored verbatim:
// `simonTitleBitmap` (title screen, plain `gbDrawBitmap` at upstream's own
// real `(0, 12+logoOffset)` position - confirmed directly against the real
// `Gamebuino::titleScreen()` source, `logoOffset` works out to 0 here since
// this game passes no title-screen name string), `simonFrameBitmap` (play-
// screen background, plain `gbDrawBitmap(10, 0, ...)`), `simonSmileyBitmap`
// (the win screen's own smiley, plain `gbDrawBitmap(34, 16, ...)`), and the
// 4 direction pads - each drawn as TWO overlaid bitmaps exactly as upstream
// does: a shared `simonButtonMaskBitmap` (upstream's own real GRAY
// "background" shape, reused via rotation/flip for all 4 directions - the
// one genuine "same base bitmap, 4 orientations" case in this game) plus
// its own distinct per-direction content bitmap (`simonTopBitmap`/
// `simonRightBitmap`/`simonBottomBitmap`/`simonLeftBitmap` - 4 separate
// real bitmaps, NOT the same art rotated, confirmed by reading their real
// byte data directly), drawn with the exact same rotation/flip constant as
// its own mask, read directly off upstream's own real `drawButtons()` call
// sites rather than guessed: top = `gbDrawBitmapRotated(30, 0, ..., 1, 0)`
// (ROTCCW/NOFLIP), right = `gbDrawBitmap(50, 12, ...)` (upstream passes no
// rotation/flip args at all here), bottom = `gbDrawBitmapRotated(30, 32,
// ..., 3, 0)` (ROTCW/NOFLIP), left = `gbDrawBitmapRotated(18, 12, ..., 0,
// 1)` (NOROT/FLIPH). All 8 real byte tables were already `0x`-hex literals
// (not Arduino `B`-binary), so every one was copied in verbatim,
// unconverted (matching gameConduit.c's own `condTitleBitmap` precedent).
//
// Each mask is drawn in real `GB_GRAY` (the shim's own dithered checkerboard
// color, matching real `Display::setColor(GRAY)`), then its own content
// bitmap on top in BLACK, matching upstream's own exact two-call-per-pad
// `setColor(GRAY); drawBitmap(mask); setColor(BLACK); drawBitmap(content);`
// sequence exactly.
//
// The center display (whose-turn indicator + sequence-length counter) is a
// direct, literal port of upstream's own real `drawButtons()` tail: the
// "whose turn" indicator is a single 2x2 BLACK dot (not text) at (37,25)
// during the CPU's own turn or (45,25) during the player's own turn, and
// the counter itself is one `cursorX = 39; cursorY = 18;
// print(melody_step - 1)` call at fontSize 1 - upstream's own exact real
// coordinates and scale, both confirmed directly against Buttons.ino rather
// than adapted to fit around the real pad bitmaps' own tighter footprint.
//
// One genuine upstream bug was found and silently normalized rather than
// preserved, since tracing it through shows it has zero effect on actual
// gameplay: the melody-seeding loop reads `melody[i - 1] = random(NBNOTES)
// + 1;` inside `for (byte i = 0; i < (NOTESMAX - 1); i++)` - on the very
// first iteration (i=0) this writes to `melody[-1]`, which on real AVR
// hardware (`byte i` is unsigned) wraps to `melody[255]`, an out-of-bounds
// write 255 elements past the real 53-element array. However, every
// *other* iteration (i=1..51) correctly fills `melody[0..50]` - exactly the
// full range the game ever actually reads (`melody_step`'s own win
// threshold means `melody_currentnote` never reaches past index 50 during
// real play) - so the array's own actually-read contents end up identical
// whether or not that one stray i=0 iteration ever ran. Ported as the
// obviously-intended `for (i = 0; i < NOTESMAX - 2; i++) simonMelody[i] =
// arand(NBNOTES) + 1;` (filling indices 0..50 directly), reproducing the
// exact same real melody contents without ever performing a genuinely
// unsafe out-of-bounds write into this cartridge's own shared global
// memory (unlike upstream's own array, "some other global variable" here
// could easily be a *different game's* own state).
//
// Two more upstream globals were dropped outright after confirming (by
// reading all 5 real source files completely) that they are genuinely
// inert: `melody_all` is only ever set to `false`, and its own single
// `if (melody_all == false) melody_all == true;` line is itself a typo
// (`==` instead of `=`) that never actually assigns it true - so it is
// never read anywhere as anything but its initial value. `melody_fail` is
// set on every failed round and reset on every game reset, but its one
// potential read site is commented out in upstream's own `key_reset()`
// (`//|| (melody_fail == true)`) - so it, too, is write-only and has no
// observable effect. `game_difficulty` likewise is set true once at reset
// and never toggled anywhere in the real source (apparently a vestigial
// hook for a difficulty option that was never wired up) - its own upstream
// display dot would therefore always just be a permanently-on pixel, so it
// was dropped along with the variable rather than ported as a meaningless
// always-on indicator.

#define SIMON_TIMER_MAX 16 // delay (real update() ticks) to play/wait one note
