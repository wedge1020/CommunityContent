// Lander (Yoda Zhang / "yodasvideoarcade", License: None specified -
// yodasvideoarcade.com/gamebuino.php). One of five "yoda-*" games this
// author wrote sharing the exact same multi-tab .ino file-split
// convention (killrace/lander/invaders/asterocks/paqman - lander.ino/
// standard.ino/specific.ino/nonstandard.ino/images.ino/sounds.ino all
// compiled as one translation unit, exactly like a single real .ino
// sketch). A real Lunar-Lander clone: fly a small ship down onto a
// scrolling, randomly-tiled landscape using two lateral thrusters (D-pad
// Left/Right) and one main thruster (Button A) against constant gravity,
// touching down gently and exactly on a marked landing pad to refuel and
// score points before running out of fuel or crashing into the terrain.
// 10 built-in levels, then a harder "gravity=1" mode once they're all
// cleared once (levels repeat, `screen = gamelevel % (maxlevel+1)`, but
// gravity now pulls down twice as often).
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a
// plain `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for
// why - this dialect has no classes/methods). `random(4)` became
// `arand(4)` (this dialect's own established RNG helper).
// `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a documented no-op.
// `gb.battery.show = false;` was dropped outright, matching every other
// port's treatment of that real-hardware-only cosmetic indicator.
// Upstream's own `and`/`or` (C++'s alternative boolean-operator spellings,
// used throughout every .ino tab here) were mechanically rewritten to
// `&&`/`||` - this dialect's own real support for the word-spelled
// alternative tokens is unconfirmed, so this port doesn't risk being the
// first to rely on them (same discipline gamePong.c/gameAgaruino.c already
// apply to `switch`). No `switch` statement existed upstream to begin
// with. Upstream's own real `String gamestatus;` compared via
// `gamestatus=="somename"` (a real Arduino `String` object with a real
// `operator==`) has no equivalent here at all (no classes/operator
// overloading) - replaced with a plain `int landState` + a `LAND_STATE_*`
// enum, one value per distinct string upstream used
// ("title"/"newgame"/"selectlevel"/"newlevel"/"newlife"/"running"/
// "gameover") plus one more state this port had to invent of its own
// (LAND_STATE_SPLASH - see "blocking titleScreen()" below).
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED. Every real `const byte PROGMEM name[]` array
// in images.ino (gamelogo, landscapetiles, spaceship, thrust, levels) was
// copied byte-for-byte (mechanically converting every Arduino
// `B00000000`-style binary literal to `0x`-prefixed hex via a small
// script reading the real .ino source directly, not hand-transcribed) into
// this dialect's own `int[N] name = {...}`/`int[N][M] name = {...}` array-
// declaration order (`TYPE[N] name`, not C's `TYPE name[N]` - see
// gameConduit.c's own `condTiles`/`condInitialMap` for the same established
// 2D-array precedent), one plain `int` per real PROGMEM byte, exactly the
// `{width, height, byte0, byte1, ...}` shape `gbDrawBitmap()` expects - no
// other conversion needed, every one of these tables already carried its
// own real width/height header per entry:
//   - `landGameLogo` (64x26, `{64,26,...}`) - the splash/title-screen logo,
//     drawn via `gbDrawBitmap(10,13,...)` at upstream's own exact real
//     anchor (both `showtitle()`'s own custom title/score screen and this
//     port's own reconstructed splash screen - see below - share this same
//     real (10,13) anchor, a deliberate visual-consistency choice this
//     port made since the splash has no anchor of its own to restore: the
//     real bitmap-drawing half of `gb.titleScreen()` isn't in this
//     upstream source at all, it's inside the real closed-source
//     `Gamebuino.cpp`).
//   - `landLandscapeTiles` (58 tiles, each 4x4, `int[58][6]`) - every
//     possible "which neighbor cells are empty" terrain-edge variant,
//     drawn tile-by-tile in `landDrawLandscape()` exactly like upstream's
//     own `drawlandscape()`.
//   - `landSpaceship` (6 frames, each 6x6, `int[6][8]`) - frame 0 = idle/
//     falling, frame 1 = any-thruster-lit (upstream lights the same single
//     "engines on" sprite for every thrust direction, not a per-thruster
//     sprite - preserved exactly), frames 2-5 = the 4-frame death
//     explosion sequence (four copies of the current frame drawn at the
//     four diagonal corners expanding outward from the ship's last
//     position, `landDrawSpaceship()`'s own dead-branch).
//   - `landThrust` (4x3, flat `int[5]`) - the small flame icon drawn next
//     to the ship on any thrust press, at upstream's own exact real
//     per-direction offsets (`shipx/10+6` for Left, `shipx/10-4` for
//     Right, `shipx/10+1,shipy/10+5` for the main thruster).
//   - `landLevels` (10 levels, each 21x12, `int[10][38]`) - each level's
//     starting terrain silhouette. No mask/fill layer exists for any of
//     these tables upstream (checked deliberately - see the header-comment
//     precedent in gameFlappyBirdo.c's own writeup on this exact bug
//     class): every sprite here is a fully self-contained outline
//     (landscape tiles are solid black already; the ship/thrust icons are
//     small enough that "off" bits being transparent reads correctly
//     against the plain white background) - nothing was skipped.
//
// A REAL, LOAD-BEARING USE OF THE GENUINE CPU-WRITABLE FRAMEBUFFER:
// `landNewLevel()` (`newlevel()` upstream) draws each level's real bitmap
// straight into the display buffer, then reads real pixels back out one
// cell at a time via `gbGetPixel()` to decide which of the 58 terrain
// tiles' edge-variants belongs at each of the 21x12 landscape cells (a
// solid cell's own 8 neighbor cells determine which "this edge is exposed"
// tile variant renders there, matching upstream's own real if-chain
// exactly, including that every check is a bare `if` rather than an
// `else if` - later matches deliberately override earlier ones for cells
// where multiple neighbor edges are exposed at once, e.g. a lone peak gets
// overridden all the way down to its own final specific tile - preserving
// this exact override order was essential, not just copying the
// individual conditions). This is the exact real technique CLAUDE.md's own
// "Source platform facts" section calls out Gamebuino Classic's hardware
// for supporting (a genuine random-access-readable framebuffer, unlike
// every TinyJoypad-lineage byte-stream-only driver) - it works here
// unmodified because this shim's own `gbDrawBitmap()`/`gbGetPixel()` are
// both real, proven ports of the real `Display::drawBitmap()`/
// `getPixel()`. Two of the eight neighbor reads (`l6`/`l8`) are computed
// but never actually used by any of the tile-selection conditions -
// preserved exactly as upstream wrote them (a real, harmless dead-read in
// the original source, not a porting artifact).
//
// STATE MACHINE / "blocking titleScreen()" TREATMENT: this game is
// unusual versus every other port in this project so far in that it has
// TWO distinct real title-screen concepts layered on top of each other,
// not one:
//   1. `showtitle()` - upstream's own CUSTOM title/high-score screen (its
//      own real drawing code, not a library call), shown whenever
//      `gamestatus=="title"`. Ported directly as LAND_STATE_TITLE /
//      `landShowTitle()` - no state-machine conversion needed here at all,
//      it was already a real polled-every-tick screen upstream, exactly
//      like every other game's own already-interactive screens.
//   2. The REAL blocking `gb.titleScreen(text, gamelogo)` library call -
//      called three separate times upstream: once in `setup()` (shown
//      once at boot, before `gamestatus` is even assigned for the first
//      time), once from `checkbuttons()` on a Button C press during
//      active gameplay (a "pause to the big splash" gesture), and once
//      more from `showtitle()` itself on a Button C press (a "show the
//      splash again from the title screen" gesture). All three converted
//      into one shared LAND_STATE_SPLASH / `landUpdateSplash()`, matching
//      the "blocking loop -> explicit resumable state" treatment used
//      throughout this project (see gamePong.c's own header comment) -
//      dismissed by a genuine fresh `gbPressed(BTN_A)`, matching real
//      `Gamebuino::titleScreen()`'s own real wait-for-Button-A semantics.
//      Real hardware boots directly into this blocking splash before
//      `gamestatus` is ever set, so `gameLander_init()` starts in
//      LAND_STATE_SPLASH too, matching that real boot order exactly.
//      A REAL UPSTREAM QUIRK PRESERVED: the boot call and the mid-game
//      Button-C call both pass `F("    Yoda's")` (four leading spaces),
//      while `showtitle()`'s own Button-C call passes `F("Yoda's")` (no
//      leading spaces) - a real, literal difference in the two source
//      files (lander.ino vs standard.ino), almost certainly the author's
//      own manual attempt at centering two differently-sized strings
//      rather than a genuine bug, but preserved exactly either way per
//      this project's own "preserve real upstream behavior/bugs by
//      default" norm: `landSplashPadded` (set at each of the three real
//      call sites to match which literal string upstream used there)
//      picks which of the two literal strings `landUpdateSplash()` prints.
//   Where upstream's own real blocking call would have frozen the whole
//   MCU for as long as the player left the splash on screen, this port's
//   non-blocking version instead lets `gbUpdate()` keep ticking every
//   real frame while LAND_STATE_SPLASH is showing - a real, necessary
//   behavior change every "blocking call -> state" conversion in this
//   project already makes (see gamePong.c's own header comment) - the
//   only games-side consequence here is that the death/gravity/fuel timers
//   are effectively paused while the splash is up (matching Pong's own
//   established precedent of an early `return` skipping the rest of that
//   tick's play logic on the same real "pause" gesture) rather than
//   upstream's own real single-loop-iteration same-tick cascade all the
//   way through a still-running game world during the block. This
//   project's own real sequential (non-`else`) `if(gamestatus==...)` chain
//   in `loop()` was otherwise preserved exactly as its own real cascading
//   dispatch in `gameLander_update()` (e.g. `landNewGame()` sets
//   `landState` to LAND_STATE_SELECTLEVEL, and since the next `if` in the
//   same tick re-reads the now-changed `landState`, `landSelectLevel()`
//   genuinely runs in that SAME tick too, exactly matching upstream's own
//   real behavior of never seeing a blank frame between `newgame`->
//   `selectlevel`->...->`running` cascades) - LAND_STATE_SPLASH's own
//   check was appended at the very end of that dispatch chain (a state
//   that never had a named `gamestatus` string of its own upstream to
//   begin with, so there's no "correct" original position for it) so that
//   a same-tick transition into it (from either `landCheckButtons()` or
//   `landShowTitle()`) still results in the splash being the last, and
//   therefore visible, thing drawn that tick - a reasonable, deliberately
//   simplified analog of upstream's own real "whatever the blocking call
//   leaves on screen when it finally returns is what's visible" behavior.
//
// A REAL SECOND UPSTREAM BUG FOUND AND PRESERVED: `drawspaceship()`'s own
// dead-ship branch (drawing the 4-way explosion) ends with its own real,
// literal call to `handledeath();` - and `loop()`'s own running-state
// block ALSO calls `handledeath();` again, unconditionally, right after
// `drawspaceship()` returns. That means `handledeath()` genuinely runs
// TWICE per real game tick for the entire duration of a death animation -
// `deadcounter` (the 30-tick countdown driving both the explosion-frame
// index and the "SHIPS LEFT" readout) actually ticks down by 2 every real
// frame, not 1, so the whole death sequence plays back roughly twice as
// fast as the literal "30" constant would otherwise suggest, and the
// "SHIPS LEFT" box gets cleared-and-redrawn twice a frame (harmless, just
// wasted cycles). This reads as a genuine copy-paste duplication bug, not
// intentional design - but since it's real, observable gameplay-timing
// behavior (not just an internal implementation detail invisible to a
// player), this port preserves it exactly: `landDrawSpaceship()` calls
// `landHandleDeath()` itself in its own dead-branch, in addition to
// `gameLander_update()`'s own separate unconditional call in the running-
// state block, exactly mirroring upstream's real double-call structure.
//
// BYTE-WRAPAROUND CLAMP TRICKS, translated to plain int comparisons: real
// `shipxspeed`/`shipyspeed` are `byte` (uint8_t) upstream. Decrementing
// them below 0 (`shipxspeed=--shipxspeed;` when already 0, or
// `shipyspeed=shipyspeed-2;` when already 0 or 1) wraps around to near 255
// on real 8-bit hardware - upstream deliberately exploits that wraparound,
// immediately following each decrement with `if (shipxspeed==255)
// shipxspeed=0;` / `if (shipyspeed>250) shipyspeed=0;`, a real "clamp at
// zero via unsigned underflow" idiom that only works because each
// decrement is a small, fixed amount (1 or 2) - the wrapped value always
// lands safely inside the specific checked band. This shim's own
// `landShipXSpeed`/`landShipYSpeed` are plain (non-wrapping) `int`s like
// every other port in this project, so the literal wraparound never
// happens here - this port instead uses a plain `if (landShipXSpeed < 0)
// landShipXSpeed = 0;` / `if (landShipYSpeed < 0) landShipYSpeed = 0;`
// after each decrement, which produces the exact same OBSERVABLE clamp-at-
// zero result upstream's own trick was actually going for, without
// depending on this shim's `int`s ever wrapping the way a real AVR `byte`
// does.
//
// A REAL, INTENTIONAL ASYMMETRY PRESERVED: `checkbuttons()` reads Left/
// Right thrust via `gb.buttons.repeat(BTN_LEFT/RIGHT, 1)` (fires every
// single tick the button stays held - continuous fine lateral control),
// but reads the main thruster via `gb.buttons.repeat(BTN_A, 0)` (real
// `Buttons::repeat()`'s own period-0 case fires only once per physical
// press, not on hold - confirmed directly against this shim's own
// `gbRepeat()`, which returns `false` outright once `period<=0` after the
// initial press). Ported as literal `gbRepeat(BTN_LEFT,1)`/
// `gbRepeat(BTN_RIGHT,1)`/`gbRepeat(BTN_A,0)` calls - main-thruster taps
// therefore genuinely only add one discrete downward-speed-reducing boost
// per press (must be re-pressed for another), while the lateral thrusters
// accelerate continuously while held. This is real, intentional upstream
// design (a lunar-lander "tap the main engine for a controlled boost,
// hold the side thrusters to steer" feel), not a porting artifact.
//
// SOUND: real `playsoundfx(fxno,channel)` builds a small per-channel
// FX-synth preset each call (waveform/instrument, volume slide, pitch/
// arpeggio slide `gb.sound.command(...)` calls, from the real
// `soundfx[][]` table) before playing one real note on top -
// `landPlaySoundFx(fxNo,channel)` is a real, faithful port of this using
// this shim's own `gbSoundCommand()`/`gbPlayNoteChannel()` primitives (a
// direct port of real Sound.h's own per-channel tracker commands). All 12
// real `playsoundfx()` call sites already passed the same real channel
// number upstream itself uses at that exact site (0 or 1), so no call
// site needed to change.
// `checkpickup()` is a genuine empty stub upstream (an apparently
// unfinished/leftover fuel-pickup feature, never actually implemented in
// this source) - ported as a literal no-op function, call site preserved,
// to keep this port's own function-per-function structure matching
// upstream 1:1.
//
// Digit-count-dependent cursor-shifting (`showtitle()`'s own
// `14-2*(score>9)-2*(score>99)-2*(score>999)` and `showscore()`'s own
// `81-4*(score>9)-...-4*(score>9999)`, both right-aligning a growing
// number by shifting its start position left one glyph-width per extra
// digit) relies on C's own "a comparison is an int 0 or 1" implicit
// conversion for direct multiplication - unproven in this dialect (no
// existing port relies on multiplying a bare comparison result), so this
// port plays it safe with an explicit `landDigitShift(value, perDigit,
// tierCount)` helper (an if-chain, not arithmetic-on-a-comparison)
// instead of risking being the first to depend on that conversion. A REAL
// UPSTREAM INCONSISTENCY preserved exactly by keeping the two call sites'
// own real `tierCount` different: `showtitle()`'s own LAST/HIGH readout
// only ever checks up to 3 extra-digit tiers (`>999`, i.e. genuinely
// misaligns a real 5-digit-or-higher score/highscore, never accounting
// for a 5th digit), while `showscore()`'s own in-game score readout checks
// a 4th tier (`>9999`) that `showtitle()` never did - a real, if minor,
// upstream inconsistency between the two screens' own real formulas, not
// a porting slip.
//
// Neither `gb.display.setFont()` nor `fontSize` is ever touched anywhere
// in this real source - every screen in this game was always meant to
// render with real hardware's own plain default font (font3x5), so this
// port never calls `gbSetFont()` either, leaving this shim's own real
// `gbBegin()`-time default (font3x5, size 1) in effect for the whole game,
// exactly matching real hardware.
//
// EEPROM PERSISTENCE ADDED, BEYOND REAL UPSTREAM - no `EEPROM.read()`/
// `EEPROM.write()` calls exist anywhere in this game's real source, so
// `landHighScore` was originally genuine in-session-only state, explicitly
// reset to 0 by upstream's own real `setup()` every single launch. Added
// directly on request once an audit found this game displays a real
// highscore that never survives a cartridge reboot: `gameLander_init()`'s
// own real `landHighScore = 0;` line is now a real `eeprom_read_word(0)`
// load instead (with the same `==0xFFFF` fresh-EEPROM-cell reset check
// already established elsewhere in this project, e.g. gameCrabator.c/
// gameDescent.c, rather than trusting a raw 65535 sentinel) - the very
// same effective "0 on a genuinely fresh card" outcome upstream's own
// hardcoded `=0` produced, just no longer discarding a real earlier save.
// Saved via `eeprom_write_word(0, landHighScore)` at the exact point
// upstream's own real highscore-tracking line already updates it in
// memory - a one-shot write per new high score, not a per-frame write.
