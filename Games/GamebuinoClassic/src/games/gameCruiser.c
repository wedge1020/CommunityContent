// Cruiser (Michael Specht / github.com/specht/cruiser) - a real portal-
// rendering 3D shooter for Gamebuino Classic: convex map "segments" (a 2D
// floor outline plus a floor/ceiling height each) connected by portals,
// rendered with Sutherland-Hodgman frustum clipping done in view space,
// fixed-point 3D math throughout, and sub-pixel-accurate Bresenham line
// drawing for the wireframe polygon edges. No LICENSE file or license
// header exists anywhere in the real upstream repo (confirmed directly -
// no top-level LICENSE/COPYING file, no header comment in cruiser.ino) -
// matching this project's own earlier porting-priority audit's "no license
// specified" finding for this game. Real author confirmed via the repo's
// own git history (`specht/cruiser`, Michael Specht).
//
// The player flies freely through the level (accelerate/turn/pitch, a
// gentle auto-leveling pitch, a subtle vertical "wobble" while moving) and
// can fire a pair of laser bolts that travel through the world and vanish
// on hitting a wall or a closed door - there is no enemy/target and no
// win/lose condition of any kind (confirmed by reading the entire real
// source: no health, lives, score, or "game over" concept exists anywhere
// upstream) - this is a real, playable flythrough tech demo of the engine
// itself, not a scored arcade game, and is ported that way faithfully
// rather than having an artificial objective added.
//
// PORTING ENTRY POINT: real upstream ships several `#define`-gated
// features that are left COMMENTED OUT in the actual shipped/compiled
// configuration (DEBUG, MONITOR_RAM, SHOW_FRAME_TIME, SHOW_TITLE_SCREEN,
// ENABLE_STRAFE, ENABLE_MAP - all `// #define X`, never enabled) - only
// COLLISION_DETECTION, ENABLE_SHOOTING, ROLL_SHIP, WOBBLE_SHIP,
// CLIP_TO_FRUSTUM, and SUB_PIXEL_ACCURACY are genuinely active. This port
// ports exactly the real active/compiled configuration and drops the
// dead `#ifdef`-gated code for the disabled features entirely (map mode,
// strafing, the debug/RAM/frame-time HUD text, and upstream's own
// gb.titleScreen() call, which - because SHOW_TITLE_SCREEN is disabled -
// is itself real dead code upstream: real `title_screen()` in the actual
// shipped build is just a state RESET, not a UI screen, called once from
// setup() and again as a real mid-game "respawn" whenever Button C is
// pressed). The `port/` subfolder (a separate, unrelated desktop/GLUT
// development harness gated behind its own `PORT_ENABLED` define, which
// this project's real build never sets) was not read or ported from at
// all, per this game's own porting brief. `sprites.h`'s entire contents
// (sprite/sprite_polygon and the sample sprite data) and cruiser.ino's own
// `render_sprite()` are also real, confirmed-dead code (the only call
// site is commented out) and were not ported either. `wall_normal_templates[]`/
// `wall_normals[]` (map.h) and `vec3d::maximize_length_16()`/
// `operator>>`/`operator>>=`/`operator<<=` (cruiser.ino) are likewise real,
// confirmed-unused leftover infrastructure (never read/called anywhere)
// and were dropped for the same reason.
//
// A real title screen (dismissed by a fresh Button-A press) was ADDED -
// not a restoration of upstream's own disabled gb.titleScreen(), which
// (see above) never actually shows anything in the real shipped build -
// but a genuine Vircon32-cartridge-specific requirement, matching every
// other game in this cartridge's own established pattern, since this
// menu launches many games from one shared A-press-driven menu (real
// standalone Gamebuino hardware has no such menu to bleed a button-press
// from). Because THIS game reads Button A directly for forward thrust
// (unlike e.g. Pong Solo, whose gameplay buttons don't overlap its own
// menu-select button), a fresh, real risk of the exact "menu-launch
// button bleeding into the game" bug class this project's CLAUDE.md
// documents was introduced by adding this title screen - fixed by
// genuinely activating upstream's own `allow_steering` gate (declared
// upstream but never given a real reason to start false, since
// SHOW_TITLE_SCREEN is disabled there): `cruiAllowSteering` starts false
// the instant the title screen is dismissed, and every directional/thrust
// control (matching upstream's own real `if (allow_steering) { ... }`
// block exactly) stays disarmed until a genuine `gbReleased(BTN_A)` fires.
//
// FIXED-POINT MATH AND THE PLATFORM-FORCED >> -> / CONVERSION: this
// dialect's `>>` is a LOGICAL (zero-fill) shift, never arithmetic/sign-
// extending, unlike real AVR's own genuine signed-int `>>`, which this
// engine's entire fixed-point 3D math relies on as a real "divide a
// SIGNED value by a power of two" idiom throughout (3D coordinates,
// directions, sin/cos outputs, dot products, and rotation math are all
// genuinely signed and routinely negative). Every `>>` in the real vec3d
// math (component-wise `>>8` in add/scale/dot/cross/normalize/rotate,
// the `>>` in project_vertex/transform_world_space_to_view_space/
// clip_polygon_against_plane/translate7/collision_detection, the camera
// rotation trig outputs, and the sub-pixel line rasterizer's own final
// `>>4` pixel-coordinate extraction) was converted to real `/` division
// instead - never behaviorally wrong even where the value happens to
// always be non-negative (division and a logical shift agree exactly
// whenever the dividend isn't negative), and correct - unlike a logical
// shift - wherever it can go negative, which is the normal case
// throughout this engine's own real 3D math. `>>` was kept ONLY for
// genuine non-negative bit/byte-unpacking operations that are not signed
// division at all: extracting a wall/portal/door index's packed nibble/
// top-bits from an encoded 0-255 map-data byte, `draw_edges` bitmask
// tests, `segments_touched[]` bit-array indexing, and one already-guarded
// case (`log2()` - not actually used by any live code path and dropped
// entirely, see below) - and for the one place a real per-frame elapsed-
// time value (`micros_per_frame`) is shifted, which is provably always
// non-negative by construction (see the timing note below) even though
// this port keeps it as a constant rather than a measured value.
//
// TIMING: real upstream reads raw Arduino `millis()`/`micros()` directly
// (not through `gb.`, so this shim has no equivalent primitive) to time
// door-open/close animation and to scale movement by real elapsed time
// each tick. Since `gbUpdate()` throttles every game here to a genuinely
// FIXED tick rate (never overridden here, so the real 20fps default - see
// this project's CLAUDE.md's own frame-rate-default writeup), this port
// treats the elapsed time per logic tick as an exact constant
// (`CRUI_MICROS_PER_FRAME` = 50000us = 1000/20fps) rather than a measured
// value - real hardware's own actual elapsed time jitters by a small,
// inconsequential amount frame to frame (Arduino loop overhead etc); this
// port's own throttle is exact, so there is no jitter to model at all.
// `cruiMillis()` (`gbFrameCount * 50`) stands in for real `millis()` for
// door-animation/shot-cooldown timing, for the same reason - `gbFrameCount`
// is the only free-running tick counter this shim exposes.
//
// STRUCTURAL DIALECT REWRITES (this dialect has no classes/methods/
// operator overloading/references/default parameters/ternary operator -
// see VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md):
// - Every `vec3d`/`vec3d_16` method and operator (`+`,`-`,`+=`,`-=`,`*`,
//   `dot()`,`cross()`,`length()`,`normalize()`,`rotate()`,`divby256()`,
//   `translate7()`) became a free `cruiVec3dXxx()` function taking
//   pointers. `vec3d_16` itself was dropped entirely and folded into one
//   `cruiVec3d` type - real upstream only used the 16-bit variant to save
//   AVR RAM for values that are already small by construction (post-
//   divby256 camera basis vectors); Vircon32 has no narrower int type at
//   all (every value is one 32-bit word regardless), so keeping two
//   parallel vector types would have bought nothing but duplication.
// - By-value struct returns (illegal here - a function's return value
//   must be exactly one word, and every real `vec3d operator+/-/*` etc.
//   upstream RETURNS a `vec3d` BY VALUE) became `void ...(..., cruiVec3d*
//   out)` out-pointer functions. Every one of these computes into a local
//   temporary and only assigns `*out = temp;` as its very last statement
//   (a real, necessary safety measure, not just a style choice - upstream's
//   own real C++ compiler-generated temporary-then-assign behavior is
//   exactly what makes e.g. `*target = target->cross(a)` safe from
//   self-aliasing in the real source; a naive direct-into-`*out` port
//   would have introduced a real aliasing bug at that exact call site,
//   where `out` IS one of the two input pointers, since `cross()`'s own
//   per-component formula reads a DIFFERENT input component than the one
//   just written on the previous line).
// - `vec3d`'s own `x/y/z` union-with-`v[3]`-array duality (used upstream
//   for real "loop over 3 components" code in `+=`/`-=`/`dot()`/`cross()`/
//   `rotate()`) was flattened to plain named `x`/`y`/`z` fields ONLY (no
//   `v[]` array view) and every one of those loops was hand-unrolled into
//   3 explicit x/y/z statements - a deliberate choice, not a dialect
//   requirement (array-typed struct members do work here, confirmed
//   directly - see below), made to avoid a real, only-partially-proven
//   pattern (a prior port's own header comment flagged this exact
//   avoidance as untested caution, not a confirmed wall) in code this
//   dense and correctness-critical.
// - `loop_through_segment_walls()`'s own real generic `bool(*callback)
//   (wall_loop_info*, void*)` function-pointer parameter (used to share
//   one wall-iteration loop between `collision_detection_callback()` and
//   `render_segment_callback()`) was NOT ported as a real function
//   pointer - but this was a real mistake in this port's own first-draft
//   investigation, since corrected (see VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md's own
//   "Function pointers" section for the full writeup): function pointers
//   DO work on this platform, proven directly by this very cartridge's
//   own `menu.h`/`menuGameList.c` (`GameFunc* init`/`update`/`onResume`,
//   driving all ~90 games via real `&function` assignment). What actually
//   fails is only the raw, standard-C *inline* declaration syntax
//   (`bool (*callback)(wall_loop_info*, void*);` -
//   `fatal error: expected a type`) - the dialect's usual
//   `<type> <name>` rule applies to function types too, so the fix is to
//   `typedef` the signature first (`typedef bool(wall_loop_info*, void*)
//   WallCallback;`) and declare the parameter as `WallCallback* callback`,
//   exactly like `menu.h`'s own `GameFunc`. This file was NOT reworked to
//   use that idiom retroactively, since the already-shipped, already-
//   verified plain int-mode dispatch below works correctly and a
//   behavior-only doc fix doesn't warrant a functional-code churn - but a
//   future porting agent should reach for the real function-pointer idiom
//   directly rather than re-discover this false negative independently.
//   Ported instead as `cruiLoopThroughSegmentWalls(..., int
//   callbackMode)`, an int-mode dispatch
//   (`CRUI_CB_COLLISION`/`CRUI_CB_RENDER`) that calls one of the two real
//   callback functions directly via a plain `if`/`else` at the one call
//   site inside the shared loop - the wall-iteration logic itself stays a
//   single shared function, only the dynamic dispatch changed shape. The
//   real `void* callback_info` threading this enabled upstream was also
//   dropped in favor of plain global scratch state per callback
//   (`cruiColl*`/the render-side globals), since a real, permanent
//   two-case dispatch has no need for it - matching this project's own
//   established "flatten to plain C, no dynamic dispatch" convention used
//   throughout every other port.
// - `polygon2`/`polygon4`/`textured_polygon4` (upstream's own separate,
//   smaller polygon variants storing only 2/4 vertex slots instead of the
//   full `MAX_POLYGON_VERTICES` 8, purely to save AVR RAM, then
//   deliberately force-cast through a plain `polygon*` - upstream's own
//   header comment literally says "THIS SAVES US 48 BYTES... PRECIOUS
//   PRECIOUS BYTES") were dropped. This pointer-reinterpretation between
//   differently-sized struct layouts has no real benefit on Vircon32 (no
//   comparable RAM pressure) and no proven-safe equivalent in a type-
//   checked, word-addressed dialect - `textured_polygon4` was unused
//   regardless (upstream's own real active code never uses texture
//   mapping). Every one of the 4 real scratch-polygon globals (`_wall`,
//   `_portal`, `_line`, `clipped_polygon`) is instead a full, uniform
//   `cruiPolygon` (8-vertex capacity) here.
// - `segment`'s real bitfields (`byte floor_height:5`, etc - a genuine
//   AVR RAM-packing trick, 8 real bytes total) became plain `int` fields
//   (no bit-fields exist in this dialect at all) - since the real map.h
//   data table's own initializer values are already the plain field
//   values themselves (not pre-packed bit patterns), the exact same
//   positional initializer list ports verbatim with no bit-math needed.
//   `frustum_plane_2d_vertex`'s own `int16_t x:12, y:12` bitfields
//   (packing 2 signed 12-bit screen coordinates into 3 bytes) likewise
//   became plain `int` fields - real values here (screen-space fixed-
//   point coordinates, max ~±700) fit comfortably inside a 12-bit signed
//   range, so dropping the bitfield changes nothing observable, only the
//   (irrelevant here) storage size.
// - The real byte-addressed, hand-packed `frustum_stack[48]` (raw pointer
//   arithmetic over mixed-type packed records: a segment-id byte, a
//   vertex-count byte, then N 3-byte 2D vertices) has no meaningful
//   equivalent in a word-addressed dialect with no byte addressing at
//   all - ported instead as a plain fixed-size array of 16 whole
//   `cruiFrustumStackEntry` records (each holding its own real 8-slot
//   `cruiFrustumVertex[8]` array - confirmed directly that a struct
//   containing an array of ANOTHER struct type compiles and runs
//   correctly here, see the dialect note below), preserving the exact
//   same LIFO push/pop order and the same graceful "stack full -> stop
//   enqueueing further portal-render jobs" degradation upstream's own
//   `push_frustum()` already has (returns a null pointer, checked by
//   every real call site) - just with real headroom (16 vs upstream's
//   own real ~3-4-deep practical capacity at 48 bytes) Vircon32 can
//   easily afford, since there is no AVR-style RAM pressure here at all.
// - `render_segment_callback_info`/`collision_detection_callback_info`
//   (upstream's own real structs threaded through the dropped void*
//   callback-info parameter above) were flattened into plain global
//   scratch variables read/written directly by the two real callback
//   functions, per the function-pointer removal above.
//
// A REAL, PREVIOUSLY-UNDOCUMENTED COMPILER QUIRK FOUND WHILE PROBING THIS
// PORT'S OWN ARCHITECTURE (worth flagging for VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md
// directly, not just noted here): a bare integer literal `0` cannot be
// used as a null-pointer constant for ANY pointer type in this compiler -
// not just named struct pointers, but plain `int*`/`void*` too. Every
// `return 0;` from a pointer-returning function, every `SomePtr* p = 0;`
// initialization, and every `if (p != 0)` comparison fails to compile
// with "cannot assign int to const-qualified <type>*" / "invalid operands
// for equality comparison" - contradicting ordinary C's implicit null-
// pointer-constant conversion. Confirmed via direct, minimal, isolated
// probes against the real compiler (not assumed). Fixed throughout this
// file by using an explicit cast everywhere a null pointer is produced or
// compared (`(cruiFrustumVertex*)0`, `(cruiPolygon*)0`, etc) - this
// affects `cruiPushFrustum()`/`cruiPopFrustum()`'s own "stack full/empty"
// null returns, `cruiRenderPolygon()`'s own "clipped away" null return,
// and every call site that checks either result.
//
// Two more real dialect facts confirmed directly by isolated compiler
// probes before committing to this file's own architecture (both
// contradicted an earlier, over-cautious assumption from a prior port's
// own header comment, which had avoided testing this at all): a struct
// CAN contain a plain array member, a nested named-struct member, and an
// array-of-another-struct-type member, all three - AS LONG AS the
// variable of that struct type is declared WITHOUT the `struct` keyword
// at the usage site (`cruiPolygon p;`, matching VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md's
// own "no `struct` keyword needed at use" - it turns out to be REQUIRED
// to omit it for these nested-member cases, not merely optional; writing
// `struct cruiPolygon p;` at a variable-declaration site fails to parse
// here even though it's exactly how the TYPE itself must be defined).
// Pointer arithmetic (`ptr + 1`) and bracket indexing on a pointer into
// an array-of-struct struct member also both work correctly. This
// confirms the natural, direct translation of `polygon`/`frustum_stack`
// (real arrays of small structs, nested inside other structs) was safe
// to use throughout this file, rather than needing a further redesign
// into parallel flat scalar arrays.
//
// REAL UPSTREAM QUIRKS/BUGS PRESERVED DELIBERATELY:
// - No near-plane clipping exists anywhere in this engine (real upstream
//   only ever clips against the four SCREEN-EDGE frustum planes, derived
//   fresh from each portal's own on-screen extent - there is no genuine
//   near/far clip plane at all). `project_vertex()`'s own `-16777216 /
//   p.z` divide can reach p.z==0 for in-view-frustum-but-behind-camera
//   geometry this engine's own math was never designed to exclude - a
//   real, inherited characteristic of the original engine, not something
//   this port introduced. **This was initially assumed dormant/unreached
//   by the real 27-segment shipped map during normal play, but a live
//   user session hit a genuine division-by-zero crash here** - unlike
//   real AVR hardware, which doesn't hard-trap on an integer divide by
//   zero, this platform's own CPU does. A platform-forced fix (not a
//   preference): `cruiProjectVertex()` now clamps a zero `p.z` to 1
//   before dividing, letting the point project somewhere extreme/
//   off-screen (matching the same kind of visual glitch real upstream's
//   own missing near-clip would already produce for a vertex very close
//   to zero) instead of crashing outright.
// - `vec3d::normalize()`'s own `(1L<<24) / length()` can likewise divide
//   by zero for a genuinely zero-length wall-normal vector (a degenerate,
//   zero-length map wall edge) - not confirmed hit in practice (no
//   degenerate walls exist in the real 27-segment map data), but given
//   the sibling `project_vertex()` risk above turned out to be live, this
//   was guarded proactively too rather than waiting for a second live
//   crash report: `cruiVec3dNormalize()` now returns early (leaving `*v`
//   as the zero vector it already is) when the input length is zero.
// - `collision_detection_callback()`'s real "am I facing this wall"
//   check, the real wall-vs-portal branch, the real project-trajectory-
//   onto-wall sliding math, and the exact real bump-distance (16384) are
//   all preserved verbatim, including upstream's own real reliance on
//   `n.dot(dir) > 0` (a real, direction-aware facing test - the exact
//   class of bug this project's CLAUDE.md's own "Pirates ported, then
//   reverted" writeup warns to check for in ported collision code; this
//   one traces back to real, correct upstream math, not a doubtful
//   substitution introduced by this port).
// - The real per-segment `normals` byte-offset field (map.h's own "N"
//   column) is real per-segment map data with real values in every row,
//   but is never actually READ by any live code path anywhere upstream
//   (confirmed directly - only ever copied around as part of a whole-
//   struct `memcpy_P`) - kept as a genuinely inert `normals_offset`
//   struct field here purely for 1:1 structural fidelity with the real
//   map.h table, exactly like real upstream's own dead field.
//
// SHIM GAPS: none found - every real primitive this game needs
// (`gbDrawPixel`, `gbPressed`/`gbReleased`/`gbRepeat`, `gbFrameCount`,
// `gbPrintString`, `gbSetFont`) already existed. The one real timing gap
// (no raw `millis()`/`micros()` equivalent) was worked around locally as
// described above, not promoted to the shared shim, since every other
// game in this cartridge already manages its own timing/animation pacing
// off `gbFrameCount` alone and has no comparable need for a real
// millisecond clock.
