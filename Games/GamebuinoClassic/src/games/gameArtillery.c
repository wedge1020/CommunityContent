// Artillery (Frakasss, no license specified -
// github.com/Frakasss/Artillery). Read completely (Artillery.ino/
// function.ino/images.ino/output.ino/sounds.ino) before porting, per this
// project's own methodology - confirms this is NOT a simple 1v1 duel: it's
// a real local, hot-seat, turn-based Worms-style artillery battle with 2-4
// TEAMS of 1-4 units each (all configured together via a real in-game
// Settings/Options screen before a match starts), any number of those teams
// optionally AI-controlled (`nbCpuTeam`, 0 up to nbTeam-1) - upstream's own
// real `Player.isIA` flag is decided per-unit from its team index
// (`team >= nbTeam - nbCpuTeam`), not from a fixed "player vs CPU" design.
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site is mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` call (this dialect has no classes/methods - see gamePong.c's
// own header comment); `byte`/`boolean` became plain `int` throughout
// (matching gameCastleDefence.c's own established convention - `dir`
// specifically needs this, since upstream uses it arithmetically,
// `(dir*2)-1`, not just as a flag); `random(0,N)` became `arand(N)`; no
// `switch` statement is used anywhere (every real upstream `switch` became
// an if/else-if chain, matching this project's own "no switch statement
// proven to work" convention). Global naming prefix: `art`.
//
// REAL BITMAP DATA: `gamelogo[]`/`landscapetiles[12][6]`/`units[4][6]`/
// `levels[26][38]`/`options[]` (images.ino) are all real Arduino
// `B00000000`-style binary literals - converted to `0x` hex by a small
// one-off local Python script (byte-count verified against each table's
// own real `{width,height,...}` header: 315 data bytes for the 72x35
// gamelogo, 26*36=936 for the 21x12 levels, 30 for the 24x10 options
// icon), matching gameCastleDefence.c's own established precedent for this
// exact situation. `trajParamX[]`/`trajParamY[]` and `soundfx[6][8]`
// (sounds.ino) were already plain decimal, copied verbatim.
//
// DEAD CODE, CONFIRMED AND NOT PORTED (matching gameCastleDefence.c's own
// "screen" precedent for exactly this situation - grep-confirmed against
// the real source, not assumed):
// - `byte landscapeZip[21][12];` (Artillery.ino) is declared but never
//   read or written anywhere else in the real source.
// - The top-level `byte nbAliveTeam;` global (Artillery.ino) is write-only
//   (set once, `nbAliveTeam = nbTeam;`, in the NEW_LEVEL case) and never
//   read - the real end-of-round alive-team count instead comes from a
//   completely separate LOCAL `byte nbAliveTeam = 0;` that shadows it
//   inside `fnctn_gameOver()`. Only the real local one is ported here (as
//   `aliveTeams`, a plain function-local in `artGameOver()`).
// - `outpt_title()` is defined but never called anywhere - every real
//   `gb.titleScreen(gamelogo)` call site invokes that directly, not through
//   this wrapper.
//
// TITLE SCREEN: real `gb.titleScreen(gamelogo)` is called at 3 real sites -
// once blocking in `main_initGame()` (setup-time), and twice more as a
// genuine "show the splash" gesture (Button C, from both the map-select and
// options screens - it does NOT return to any top-level menu, it just shows
// the logo until A is pressed again, then resumes exactly where it was).
// Converted into one shared `ART_TITLE` state plus an `artTitleReturnState`
// field remembering which of the two mid-game screens to resume (matching
// this project's own "blocking loop -> explicit resumable state" treatment,
// e.g. gamePong.c/gameCastleDefence.c). Real `main_initGame()`'s own
// config-default-setting code (upstream places it textually AFTER its own
// blocking `titleScreen()` call) instead runs immediately in
// `gameArtillery_init()`, before the title is ever shown - behaviorally
// identical, since nothing reads those config vars while the title screen
// is up either way.
//
// SOUND: `artPlaySoundFx()` is a direct, byte-for-byte port of real
// upstream's own `outpt_soundfx(byte fxno)` - the same 4
// `gbSoundCommand()` calls (volume/instrument/slide/arpeggio, always
// channel 0, matching upstream's own hardcoded `0` argument throughout)
// plus a final `gbPlayNoteChannel()`, against the existing `artSoundFx[][]`
// table.
//
// PRESERVED REAL UPSTREAM BUGS (kept exactly as shipped, matching this
// project's own default per CLAUDE.md):
// 1) `fnctn_checkPlayerPos()`'s real "get unstuck" test -
//    `if(getPixel(x+2,y+3)==1 || getPixel(x+1,y+3)==1 && dead==0)` - is a
//    genuine operator-precedence trap (`&&` binds tighter than `||`, so
//    this is really `A || (B && C)`): the x+2 column check pushes ANY
//    player up regardless of `dead`, while only the x+1 column check is
//    gated on `dead==0`. Ported with the same real precedence
//    (`artCheckPlayerPos()` below), not "cleaned up" into `(A||B)&&C`.
// 2) `fnctn_ia()`'s real target-search simulation computes `rocket.x`
//    using `trajParamY[...]` (not `trajParamX[...]`) for the HORIZONTAL
//    offset, at both places it builds a candidate shot - a likely copy-
//    paste slip from the real firing code in `fnctn_checkbuttons()`
//    (which correctly uses `trajParamX` there). Ported exactly
//    (`artAiThink()` below uses `artTrajParamY` for `artRocket.x` too) -
//    "fixing" this would give the AI a genuinely different (arguably
//    better) simulated aim than upstream ever shipped.
// 3) The AI's own angle search loop (`for(fct_countr2=8;fct_countr2>0;
//    fct_countr2--)`) never tries index 0 - the AI never considers the
//    maximum-elevation shot a human player can select. Ported with the
//    same real loop bound.
//
// DELIBERATE SAFETY ADAPTATIONS (not preserved bugs - real AVR byte
// wraparound papering over an out-of-bounds risk that this project's own
// avrCompat.h convention does not reproduce, see gameCastleDefence.c's own
// header comment on this exact convention):
// - Real `Rocket.y` is an unsigned `byte` upstream; a steep upward shot
//   that pushes it "negative" really wraps to a large positive value on
//   real hardware, which eventually satisfies the search loop's own
//   `rocket.y>48` exit test. This shim's `artRocket.y` is a full-range
//   `int` (no wraparound), so `artAiThink()`'s own inner `while` loop adds
//   an explicit `artRocket.y < 0` exit check upstream never needed - without
//   it, a steep-upward simulated shot could loop forever instead of
//   terminating.
// - Every `landscape[x][y]` read/write whose index derives from a live
//   rocket position (`artCheckCollision()`, `artRebuildMap()`,
//   `artAiThink()`) goes through two small bounds-safe helpers,
//   `artLandscapeGetOr()`/`artLandscapeSet()`, instead of a raw array
//   access - real hardware's own equivalent out-of-range index either gets
//   caught by the same byte-wraparound or reads/writes adjacent real AVR
//   RAM (harmless there); this dialect has no such safety net; an actual
//   out-of-bounds array access here is undefined and could silently
//   corrupt an unrelated global. `artLandscapeSet()` also fixes a genuine
//   off-by-one in upstream's OWN already-present defensive bound checks
//   inside `fnctn_rebuildMap()` (`<=21`/`<=12`, where the real valid index
//   range for a `[21][12]` array is `<=20`/`<=11`) - the original author
//   clearly intended to guard exactly this case and simply miscounted, so
//   the corrected bound serves that same, obviously-intended purpose
//   rather than reproducing the typo and risking real memory corruption.
//
// No real `setColor(GRAY)`/`setColor(INVERT with a bitmap)`/`setFont()`/
// `EEPROM.*` call exists anywhere in the real source (grep-confirmed
// directly) - `GB_INVERT` IS used (real explosion-flash animation in
// `outpt_boom()`), ported directly as `GB_INVERT`; no GRAY, no custom font
// (inherits this shim's own real `gbFont3x5` default, matching every other
// ported game that never calls `setFont()` upstream either), no EEPROM
// (no save data upstream).
