// Solitaire (Andy O'Neill / aoneill01, MIT license -

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// CLASS FLATTENING (Card/Pile/UndoStack -> structs + free functions)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// This dialect has no classes/methods (see gamebuinoShim.h's own header
// comment) - the same "flatten a real single-instance C++ library into
// plain C globals/functions" treatment used for gb itself applies equally
// to every OTHER real class upstream defines, matching the precedent
// already set porting SuperSpaceShooter's own classes in the sibling
// project:
//
// - `Card` (real upstream: a class wrapping one private `byte _value`,
//   value/suit/face-down bit-packed exactly as documented in card.cpp) is
//   flattened to a PLAIN `int` here, with the identical bit layout
//   (`soliMakeCard()`/`soliCardValue()`/`soliCardSuit()`/
//   `soliCardIsFaceDown()`/`soliCardIsRed()`/`soliCardFlip()` are direct
//   ports of `Card`'s own constructor/getters/`flip()`). This is a
//   deliberate, load-bearing choice, not just a simplification: a plain
//   `int` is exactly one word, so it can be returned BY VALUE from
//   functions like `soliPileGetCard()`/`soliPileRemoveTopCard()` (this
//   dialect's real "functions cannot return values of size > 1" rule -
//   see VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md section 4/15.1) exactly like real
//   `Pile::getCard()`/`removeTopCard()` return `Card` by value upstream -
//   no out-pointer rewrite needed anywhere a `Card` crosses a function
//   boundary, because it was never more than one word to begin with.
// - `Pile` (real upstream: a class owning a heap-allocated `Card
//   _cards[]`, `_count`, `_maxCards`, plus public `x`/`y`/`isTableau`)
//   becomes `struct SoliPile` (scalar fields only: `id`/`maxCards`/
//   `count`/`x`/`y`/`isTableau`) plus free functions
//   (`soliPileAddCard()`/`soliPileAddPile()`/`soliPileGetCardCount()`/
//   `soliPileGetCard()`/`soliPileRemoveTopCard()`/`soliPileRemoveCards()`/
//   `soliPileEmpty()`/`soliPileShuffle()`/`soliPileNewDeck()`/
//   `soliPileGetMaxCards()`) taking `SoliPile*` where upstream took
//   `this`. The real per-pile card array is NOT stored as an array field
//   inside `SoliPile` itself - no other game shipped in this project has
//   proven an array-typed struct MEMBER compiles here (2D array
//   GLOBALS are proven, e.g. gameCastleDefence.c's own
//   `CdefFenceBitmaps`, but that's a different position in the grammar
//   than an array field inside a `struct { ... };` body) - rather than
//   spend a compile-error cycle finding out, every pile's cards live in
//   one shared global `int[SOLI_PILE_COUNT][SOLI_PILE_CAPACITY]
//   soliPileCards` table, and `SoliPile.id` is just the row index into
//   it. Every one of the 13 real board piles (stock/talon/4 foundations/7
//   tableau columns) uses its own real upstream `Location` enum value
//   (see below) directly as its row id, and the `moving` pile (upstream's
//   own real animation staging area, `Pile moving = Pile(13)`) gets the
//   one remaining row. This is an implementation-strategy choice made out
//   of caution, not a confirmed compiler rejection - flagged here per
//   this project's own "flag genuinely uncertain workarounds" norm, not
//   because a real wall was hit. Real per-pile capacities (stock=52,
//   talon=24, each foundation=13, each tableau column=20, moving=13) are
//   preserved exactly via each instance's own `maxCards` field, INCLUDING
//   real upstream's own tableau-column overflow behavior (`addCard()`
//   silently drops a card once `count == maxCards` - a real, virtually
//   unreachable-in-practice 20-card-per-column cap upstream ships with,
//   not "fixed" into unlimited here).
// - `UndoAction` (real upstream: a plain struct, not a class, but WITH
//   methods - `setCardCount()`/`getCardCount()`/`setRevealed()`/
//   `wasRevealed()`/`setDraw()`/`wasDraw()`/`setFlippedTalon()`/
//   `wasFlippedTalon()`, all just bit-twiddling one `byte special` field)
//   becomes `struct SoliUndoAction` (plain `int special`, plus
//   `sourceLoc`/`destLoc`) with the same 8 accessors as free functions
//   taking `SoliUndoAction*`. Real upstream's `source`/`destination`
//   fields are typed `Pile*` there; here they are `Location`-style int
//   IDs instead (`soliGetPileByLocation()` resolves one back to a real
//   `SoliPile*` on demand) - again a defensive choice avoiding an
//   unproven "pointer-typed struct member" pattern (as opposed to a
//   pointer LOCAL/GLOBAL/parameter/return, all of which are used freely
//   elsewhere in this file and are unambiguously supported), not a
//   confirmed rejection. Every real call site that used to write directly
//   into `action.source`/`.destination` instead computes the equivalent
//   `Location` value inline (always available at that exact point in the
//   real control flow - `sourcePile` is always one of the 13 real named
//   piles, never the `moving` staging pile itself).
// - `UndoStack` (real upstream: a class wrapping a fixed
//   `UndoAction[UNDO_STACK_SIZE]` ring buffer) becomes plain globals
//   (`soliUndoActions[10]`/`soliUndoIndex`/`soliUndoCount`) plus
//   `soliUndoPush()`/`soliUndoPop()`/`soliUndoIsEmpty()`. `soliUndoPop()`
//   takes an out-pointer rather than returning `SoliUndoAction` by value,
//   since that struct is 3 words (over this dialect's real 1-word
//   function-return limit) - the exact "convert a by-value struct return
//   into an out-pointer parameter" idiom VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md documents
//   (section 15.2) for exactly this situation.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a
// plain `gbY(...)` function call (this dialect has no classes/methods -
// see gamePong.c's own header comment). `byte` became plain `int`
// (avrCompat.h). Real upstream `switch` statements (`getActiveLocationPile()`,
// `drawSuit()`, `drawValue()`) all became if/else-if chains, matching this
// project's own "no switch statement used anywhere in this project's
// ported games" convention. Real `byte&`/`bool&` reference-out parameters
// (`getCursorDestination(byte& x, byte& y, bool& flipped)`) became real
// `int*`/`bool*` pointer-out parameters. `min()`/`max()` (Arduino macros)
// became `gbMin()`/`gbMax()` (no ternary operator in this dialect, so a
// `(a<b?a:b)`-style macro wouldn't have compiled either). `random(N)`
// became `arand(N)`; the one real ranged case,
// `random(0x0100,0x0200)`/`random(0x0200)` (the win-animation card-bounce
// initial velocity), became `0x0100 + arand(0x0100)`/`arand(0x0200)` (this
// project's own established ranged-random conversion formula). Every real
// array declaration uses this dialect's own required `TYPE[N] name`
// order, never `TYPE name[N]`. Global naming prefix: `soli` (checked
// unused by every other game shipped or concurrently in flight in this
// batch).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// BLOCKING SCREENS -> EXPLICIT STATE MACHINE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Real upstream's `showTitle()` is a single function with a real `goto`-
// driven loop (a `start:` label re-entered on menu cancel, an `askAgain:`
// label re-entered after viewing statistics) mixing a blocking
// `gb.titleScreen()` call, a blocking `gb.menu()` call, and blocking
// `displayStatistics()`/`pause()` calls - all converted here into five
// explicit `SOLI_APP_*` states (`_TITLE`/`_NEWGAME_MENU`/`_STATS`/
// `_PLAYING`/`_PAUSE_MENU`), matching the "blocking loop -> explicit
// resumable state" treatment this project uses throughout (see
// gamePong.c's own header comment). Real upstream's own binary
// `gb.menu(items, count)` widget (used for both the new-game menu and the
// pause menu) has no equivalent in this shim - hand-rolled UP/DOWN-
// navigate, A-to-confirm replacements (`soliUpdateNewGameMenu()`/
// `soliUpdatePauseMenu()`) follow this project's own established
// `gameConduit.c`-style precedent exactly (no cancel gesture, matching
// that same precedent - real `gb.menu()`'s own actual cancel button isn't
// knowable without real `Menu.cpp` source, unavailable in this isolated
// copy). Real `Gamebuino::titleScreen()`'s own internal text/logo layout
// is not reproduced (a real library internal, not upstream's own code) -
// this port draws the real logo bitmap directly (`soliTitleBitmap`,
// copied byte-for-byte from upstream's own real `title[]` PROGMEM table)
// with this port's own simple centered "PRESS A" prompt beneath it,
// matching the same treatment `gameBlockdude.c` already established for
// its own real titleScreen() splash bitmap.
//
// Real upstream's pause menu shows only 3 items (Resume/Quit/Statistics)
// when paused mid-ANIMATION (`mode != selecting` - Save/Undo would be
// unsafe against a pile mid-transfer) and 4 or 5 items (adding Save, then
// Undo if the undo stack isn't empty) when paused with the cursor
// genuinely idle (`mode == selecting`) - preserved exactly via
// `soliUpdatePauseMenu()`'s own `fullMenu`/`showUndo` gate, reading
// `soliMode` directly (mode itself is simply never advanced while paused,
// since `soliUpdatePlaying()` - the only place mode-driven logic runs -
// is not called at all while `soliAppState == SOLI_APP_PAUSE_MENU`,
// matching upstream's own real "pause() blocks the rest of loop() from
// ever running" behavior).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// SOUND: a real, direct port - patternA/patternB now play for real
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Real upstream calls `gb.sound.playPattern(patternA/B, 0)` from
// `playSoundA()`/`playSoundB()` - two tiny real note patterns (3 words
// each, `const uint16_t patternA[]/patternB[] PROGMEM`), now ported
// verbatim as `soliPatternA`/`soliPatternB` (byte-for-byte identical hex
// values, real `0x0000` terminator preserved) and played for real via
// `gbPlayPattern()` - the real tracker/pattern engine this shim now
// implements (see gamebuinoShim.h's own Sound section header comment).
// Neither pattern is preceded upstream by a `changeInstrumentSet()`/
// `command(CMD_INSTRUMENT,...)` call, so both correctly play through
// channel 0's own real default square-wave instrument, matching real
// hardware exactly - no approximation needed anymore. `soliPlaySoundA()`
// (real call sites: drawing/dealing a card, triggering a fast-foundation
// auto-move) and `soliPlaySoundB()` (real call sites: attempting to place
// a held pile - fires on every attempt, legal or not, not specifically an
// error cue - and the win-animation's own bounce-off-the-bottom impact)
// are otherwise unchanged - same call sites, same real upstream trigger
// conditions, just genuine pattern playback instead of a one-shot-tone
// stand-in now that the shim supports it.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// EEPROM: a full, real port (statistics AND save-for-later), not a stub
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Real upstream's `readEeprom()`/`writeEeprom()`/`savePile()`/
// `loadPile()` are ported through this shim's own `eeprom_read_byte()`/
// `eeprom_write_byte()`/`eeprom_update_byte()`/`eeprom_read_word()`/
// `eeprom_write_word()` (see eepromShim.h) at the exact same real byte
// addresses upstream uses:
//   addr 0        - magic number (170, `SOLI_EEPROM_MAGIC_NUMBER`)
//   addr 1-2/3-4/5-6/7-8 - easyGameCount/easyGamesWon/hardGameCount/
//                    hardGamesWon (real upstream `int`s, 2 bytes each via
//                    `EEPROM.put()` - ported via `eeprom_write_word()`/
//                    `eeprom_read_word()`, a direct, mechanical
//                    equivalent, not a behavioral change, matching
//                    `gameBlockdude.c`'s own established word-vs-two-byte
//                    reasoning)
//   addr 9        - "has a saved game" flag (real upstream `EEPROM.update`)
//   addr 10       - cardsToDraw (1 real byte)
//   addr 11+      - each of the 13 real board piles, stock/talon/4
//                    foundations/7 tableau columns in that exact real
//                    order, each as 1 count byte + that pile's own real
//                    `maxCards` card bytes (`soliSavePile()`/
//                    `soliLoadPile()`, direct ports of upstream's own
//                    `savePile()`/`loadPile()`) - 281 bytes total,
//                    comfortably inside this shim's own 1024-byte-per-
//                    game EEPROM slot.
// `soliReadEeprom()` explicitly sets `soliContinueGame = false` on a
// magic-mismatch (upstream instead just returns, leaving `continueGame`
// at whatever it last was) - a safe, purely-defensive simplification, not
// a behavior change: `continueGame` is a plain global that always starts
// at C's own zero-init `false` by construction, matching what an
// unconditional explicit reset produces in every real reachable case
// (this function is only ever called once per real title-screen visit,
// and every prior visit that ever set it `true` also always writes the
// magic byte back via `soliWriteEeprom()`, so a stale `true` from a
// previous visit can never survive to be silently reused here).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// A REAL UPSTREAM BUG FOUND AND PRESERVED: the win-animation "cards
// bounce off the foundations" sequence never actually plays
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Traced directly through the real source, not assumed: `showTitle()`
// unconditionally sets `gb.display.persistence = true;` as its own very
// first line - and `showTitle()` is the ONLY setup path in the entire
// game (called once from `setup()`, and again from every real `pause()`
// "Quit"/"Save for later" branch) - so `persistence` is already `true`
// before any real gameplay frame is ever drawn, on every single run.
// Nothing in the entire real source ever sets it back to `false`.
// `drawWonGame()`'s own real logic is `if (!gb.display.persistence) {
// gb.display.persistence = true; drawBoard(); initializeCardBounce(); }`
// - since `persistence` is already `true` by the time `drawWonGame()` can
// ever run at all, this branch is genuine, real, unreachable dead code:
// `initializeCardBounce()` - the ONLY place a foundation card is ever
// actually picked up and given a real bounce velocity - is never called.
// The physics code just below the dead branch still runs unconditionally
// every tick regardless, though, operating on `bounce`'s own real,
// zero-initialized default fields (`x=0,y=0,xVelocity=0,yVelocity=0`,
// `card` defaulting to a real upstream `Card()` - ace of spades, face up)
// - so what actually happens on real hardware, traced through
// completely: gravity accumulates on `yVelocity` every tick, `y` grows
// from 0 and eventually exceeds the bottom-bounce threshold, reversing
// and damping `yVelocity` by the real `*-4/5` formula forever - i.e. a
// single default ace-of-spades card bounces up and down forever at a
// permanently-fixed `x=0` (since `xVelocity` is never set away from its
// zero default), and the exit condition
// (`bounce.x+(10<<8)<0 || bounce.x>LCDWIDTH<<8`) can never fire (`x`
// never moves), so `showTitle()` is never called again automatically -
// winning the game does NOT show the intended 52-card celebratory
// sequence and does NOT return to the title screen on its own. This is
// preserved here exactly (`soliPersistence` mirrors the real field,
// `soliBeginTitle()` sets it `true` at the same real call site,
// `soliDrawWonGame()`'s own dead branch is real, unreachable dead code
// here too, for the identical reason) - per this project's own rule to
// preserve a genuine, traced-through upstream bug rather than silently
// fix it. A player is not stuck, though: real upstream's own `pause()`
// (Button C, checked unconditionally at the very top of `loop()`
// regardless of `mode`) still works during this stuck bounce, and
// choosing "Quit" from there is a real, working way back to the title
// screen - reproduced identically here via `soliUpdatePlaying()`'s own
// `gbPressed(BTN_C)` check running before any mode dispatch, exactly
// mirroring upstream's own unconditional placement.
//
// One deliberate Vircon32-specific adaptation on top of that real, traced
// bug: this shim has no equivalent to real `Display::persistence` at the
// RENDERING level at all (`gbUpdate()` always calls `gbClear()` every
// real tick unconditionally - see this project's own CLAUDE.md and
// `gameBlockdude.c`'s/`game2048.c`'s own header comments on why dropping
// persistence is always safe here: every game already redraws everything
// relevant every tick). Faithfully leaving `soliDrawBoard()` un-called
// during the stuck-bounce state (mirroring upstream's own real "never
// redraws the board again" behavior under this bug) would render as a
// genuinely BLANK screen behind the bouncing card here (since nothing
// else ever draws over the auto-cleared buffer), materially WORSE than
// real hardware's own frozen-last-frame appearance - a second,
// independent, pre-existing shim limitation compounding with the first,
// real bug to produce a strictly worse result than real hardware ever
// had. `soliDrawWonGame()` therefore calls `soliDrawBoard()`
// unconditionally every tick regardless of `soliPersistence` (matching
// the same "call the real full redraw unconditionally since the shim
// always clears anyway" adaptation `game2048.c`/`gameBlockdude.c` already
// made for their own dropped `persistence` usage) - this correctly shows
// the true, static, fully-won board (all 4 foundations still full, since
// `initializeCardBounce()` never runs to remove a card from them) with
// the one stuck bouncing default card on top, matching what the traced-
// through real bug actually produces in spirit, without the unrelated
// "blank screen" artifact a literal one-time-only redraw would add here.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// A VIRCON32-DIALECT-SPECIFIC FIX: logical, not arithmetic, right shift
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Real upstream extracts pixel coordinates from the win-animation's own
// 8.8 fixed-point `bounce.x`/`bounce.y` via `bounce.x >> 8`/`bounce.y >>
// 8` - safe on real AVR hardware, where `>>` on a signed `int` sign-
// extends. VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md documents directly that this dialect's
// `>>` is a LOGICAL shift (zero-fill, not sign-extending) - confirmed as
// a real, previously-hit bug in this exact codebase already
// (avrCompat.h's own `arand()` header comment describes the identical
// hazard biting a different game's own hollow-frequency formula). Given
// this preserved bug keeps `bounce.x` permanently at exactly `0` (see
// above - never negative in practice), only `bounce.y` is a real
// theoretical risk (a large rebound could in principle carry `y`
// transiently above the top of the screen, i.e. negative, before
// gravity pulls it back down) - `soliDrawWonGame()` uses plain integer
// division (`/ 256`) instead of `>> 8` for both coordinate extractions,
// a simple, safe substitute that cannot misinterpret a negative
// fixed-point value as a huge positive one (differing from a true
// arithmetic shift by at most 1 pixel on a negative, non-multiple-of-256
// input - immaterial for this purely decorative animation). The `<< 8`
// conversions elsewhere are never given this treatment since they only
// ever shift small non-negative pixel coordinates, where logical and
// arithmetic shifts agree exactly.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// SHIM PRIMITIVES USED - no new primitive needed
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every drawing/input/sound/EEPROM primitive this port needs already
// exists in `gamebuinoShim.h`/`eepromShim.h`
