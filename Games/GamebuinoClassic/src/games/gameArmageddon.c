// Armageddon (wuuff, GPLv3 - real LICENSE file confirmed,
// github.com/wuuff/armageddon). A Worms/Missile-Command-style artillery
// defense game: move a shared crosshair with the D-pad and fire from
// launcher one (Button A) or launcher two (Button B) to detonate incoming
// enemy missiles above your 6 cities before they land. Clearing every
// enemy missile in a wave starts a "BONUS POINTS" lull screen (unused
// ammo and any still-standing cities are cashed in for points one at a
// time) before the next, harder stage begins. Losing every city (the two
// launcher sites don't count) ends the game and offers a 5-entry
// highscore table. Upstream ships as three real `.ino` tabs compiled as
// one translation unit (AGEDDON.ino/highscores.ino/sound.ino) - merged
// into this one file exactly the same way, no functional change from that
// merge alone. No IR-link/two-cart networking code exists anywhere in any
// of the three files (confirmed by reading all of them in full) - genuinely
// single-player, as the porting-priority audit already expected.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why -
// this dialect has no classes/methods). `random(N)` became `arand(N)`
// (this dialect's own established RNG helper - upstream never uses the
// ranged `random(min,max)` form anywhere in this game). `gb.pickRandomSeed()`
// became `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a documented no-op. `gb.battery.show = false`
// (set twice upstream: once in setup(), once again in checkMenu() right
// after re-showing the title screen) was dropped outright both times,
// matching every other ported game's identical treatment of that real-
// hardware-only cosmetic flag. Upstream's own `switch(mode)` in loop()
// became an if/else-if chain (this dialect's exact `switch` support is
// unproven - same caution gamePong.c/gameAgaruino.c/gameConduit.c already
// took).
//
// ARRAY DECLARATION ORDER: every array below uses this dialect's own
// `TYPE[N] name` order, not C's `TYPE name[N]` (see gameConduit.c's own
// tile arrays for the established precedent). Every real PROGMEM bitmap
// byte became one plain `int` cell.
//
// FLATTENED PER-MISSILE TRACKING ARRAYS: upstream keeps each missile's
// state in a genuine 2D array - `uint8_t pDests[MAX_PMISSILES][2]`,
// `float pMissiles[MAX_PMISSILES][3]`, `uint8_t pDetonations[MAX_PMISSILES][4]`,
// `float eMissiles[MAX_EMISSILES][4]`. Every confirmed real 2D array
// anywhere else in this project (gameConduit.c's `condMap`/`condTiles`,
// gameAsterocks.c's `asterShipFrames`/`asterSoundFx`, gameLander.c's
// `landLandscape`/`landLandscapeTiles`) is always `int`/byte-valued - no
// ported game anywhere in this codebase has yet proven a 2D *float* array
// actually compiles in this dialect. Rather than being the first to find
// out the hard way, every one of upstream's 2D per-missile tables was
// flattened here into parallel same-length 1D arrays instead (e.g.
// `pMissiles[i][0]/[1]/[2]` became `armaPMissileX[i]`/`armaPMissileY[i]`/
// `armaPMissileLauncher[i]`) - purely a storage-layout change, zero
// behavioral difference, and it sidesteps the open question entirely.
//
// BLOCKING `gb.titleScreen(armageddon)` -> EXPLICIT STATE: upstream calls
// this real, blocking library function twice - once in setup() (the very
// first thing the player sees) and again from checkMenu() any time Button
// C is pressed during any of the other four modes (a genuine "pause to
// the title/logo screen" gesture, since mode itself is left completely
// unchanged underneath the blocking call and simply resumes once dismissed).
// Both call sites became one shared `ARMA_STATE_TITLE`, with `armaPrevState`
// recording whichever state was interrupted so Button A resumes exactly
// there - the same "blocking widget -> explicit resumable state" treatment
// as gamePong.c's own PONG_STATE_TITLE, just with an explicit resume target
// instead of always going to one fixed state, since upstream's own version
// can be triggered mid-game and must return to *that* game, not the menu.
// The real `Gamebuino::titleScreen(logo)` library function itself draws the
// passed-in logo bitmap at a fixed (0, 12) screen anchor - confirmed
// directly against the real Gamebuino.cpp source during gameFlappyBirdo.c's/
// gameUfoRace.c's own ports of that exact same real function - reused
// unchanged here (`armaUpdateTitle()` below) since armageddon's own real
// title bitmap is, like those two, exactly 64x36: at y=12 its own bottom
// row lands exactly on LCDHEIGHT (48), zero clipping. Real `titleScreen()`
// draws no text of its own at all - the "PRESS A" prompt above the logo is
// this port's own added UI affordance (every other ported game restoring a
// real `titleScreen()` call needed the exact same addition).
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED: all 5 real upstream bitmaps - the 64x36
// `armageddon` title/logo bitmap and the four real 8x8 `city`/`deadcity`/
// `launcher`/`deadlauncher` sprites - were extracted byte-for-byte via a
// small Python script that parsed the real .ino source directly (stripping
// `/* */` block comments first, since upstream keeps an old, unused,
// commented-out alternate `city[]` bitmap directly above the real active
// one - the script was careful to only ever match the real active
// (uncommented) array, matching upstream's own actual shipped choice) and
// converted every `B00000000`-style binary literal to `0x` hex, verifying
// each array's own real body byte count against its own declared
// width/height header before trusting it (64x36 -> 288 body bytes; every
// 8x8 sprite -> 8 body bytes) - not hand-transcribed. Drawn directly via
// `gbDrawBitmap()` at upstream's own exact real coordinates (`armaUpdateTitle()`
// for the logo; `armaDrawCities()` for the 4 city/launcher states, at each
// city's own real `i*10+2, 40` position). Checked for the mask/fill-under-
// bitmap bug class found in gameFlappyBirdo.c/gameParachute.c: it does NOT
// apply here - every one of upstream's `drawBitmap()` call sites in
// `drawCities()` is a single, complete, self-contained opaque sprite with
// no separate mask/fill array or GRAY fill drawn underneath it anywhere in
// the real source.
//
// SOUND - a faithful, byte-for-byte port of real `playSound(i)`: `armaSounds`
// is upstream's own real `sounds[][5]` wave/pitch/duration/arpeggio-step-
// duration/arpeggio-step-size table, and `armaPlaySound()` drives the same
// real `gb.sound.command(CMD_VOLUME,5,0,...)/command(CMD_SLIDE,0,0,...)/
// command(CMD_ARPEGGIO,...)/command(CMD_INSTRUMENT,...)` sequence before
// `gbPlayNoteChannel()`, in upstream's own exact order, all on channel 0.
// Real upstream's own `initSound()` (setting the same VOLUME/SLIDE commands
// once at startup) is genuine dead code - never called anywhere in the real
// source - and was not ported, since `playSound()` already re-sends both of
// those same two commands on every single call.
//
// HIGHSCORE NAME ENTRY - DROPPED, DOCUMENTED (matching an exact existing
// precedent, not a new gap): upstream's own `gb.getDefaultName(tmp_name)` +
// `gb.keyboard(tmp_name, 11)` (a real on-screen text-entry widget) has no
// equivalent anywhere in this shim - confirmed against gamebuinoShim.h's
// full real API surface, and already found and documented identically by
// gameUfoRace.c's own highscore table. Per-name storage was dropped
// entirely rather than faked with a placeholder string: `armaHighscores[]`
// is a plain scores-only table, and `armaDrawHighscores()` shows only the
// five real scores, right-aligned at upstream's own real screen position,
// with nothing invented in the name column upstream used to occupy.
//
// EEPROM - REAL BYTE-LEVEL PERSISTENCE, WITH TWO REAL UPSTREAM BUGS FOUND
// AND FIXED RATHER THAN PRESERVED (both explained in full below - this
// project's usual default is to preserve real bugs, but both of these are
// genuine, unintentional defects with no sane literal port target, not
// quirky-but-harmless real behavior worth keeping faithfully):
//
//   1) A REAL 5-BYTES-INTO-A-4-BYTE-VALUE OVERFLOW. Upstream's own
//      `loadHighscores()`/`saveHighscore()` read/write each entry as
//      `ENTRY_SIZE` (15) raw EEPROM bytes: the first `NAME_SIZE` (10) are
//      the name, and the real code then walks a raw `uint8_t* addr =
//      (uint8_t*)&highscores[entry]; addr += offset-NAME_SIZE;` pointer
//      across the *remaining* `offset` values 10..14 - that's 5 byte
//      writes into a `uint32_t`, which is only ever 4 bytes wide. On real
//      hardware this silently corrupts the low byte of the *next* entry's
//      own score (or walks straight past the end of the array on the very
//      last entry) every single time a highscore is saved - a genuine,
//      unintentional buffer-overflow bug, not a deliberate design choice.
//      This shim has no raw address-of-array-element pointer trick to even
//      attempt reproducing this literally in the first place (no classes,
//      no confirmed arbitrary pointer arithmetic across a flattened global
//      array here), and doing so on purpose would just be reintroducing
//      real memory corruption for no gameplay benefit - so `armaSaveHighscore()`/
//      `armaLoadHighscores()` below use a clean, correct 4-bytes-per-entry
//      layout instead, still via `eeprom_read_byte()`/`eeprom_write_byte()`
//      one byte at a time (matching upstream's own real byte-level
//      `EEPROM.read()`/`EEPROM.write()` calls exactly, per this task's own
//      instructions on matching upstream's real byte-width - upstream never
//      calls anything wider than a single byte at a time, so `eeprom_read_dword()`/
//      `eeprom_write_dword()` were deliberately NOT used even though they'd
//      have been more convenient), using the shim's own established real
//      big-endian byte order (matching `eepromShim.c`'s own `eeprom_read_dword()`/
//      `eeprom_write_dword()` formula, `(b0<<24)|(b1<<16)|(b2<<8)|b3`, MSB
//      first) purely for in-codebase consistency - fixed rather than
//      preserved, unlike this project's usual default, since the
//      alternative was actively harmful, not just quirky.
//
//   2) A REAL "PERMANENTLY LOCKED ON A FRESH CARTRIDGE" BUG. Nowhere in
//      `highscores.ino` is there any code to detect or initialize a truly
//      fresh EEPROM (unlike, say, gameUfoRace.c's own `initHighscore()`,
//      which at least has an inert `==0` dead-code check for this exact
//      situation). This project's own eepromShim.c deliberately reads
//      fresh/unwritten cells as 0xFF each, matching real AVR's own factory-
//      erased state (per this project's own CLAUDE.md) - so on a genuinely
//      fresh card, every `armaHighscores[]` entry would decode straight
//      from raw 0xFF bytes to the sentinel value 4294967295, and
//      `armaIsHighscore(score)` (`score > armaHighscores[NUM-1]`) could
//      then never return true, since a real game score can never reach 4
//      billion - permanently locking out the entire highscore feature,
//      since `armaSaveHighscore()` is only ever called from behind that
//      same check. This reads like a genuine gap in the real upstream code
//      (most likely never actually observed by its own author, if it was
//      only ever tested against an already-used EEPROM chip) rather than
//      deliberate design worth preserving faithfully. `armaLoadHighscores()`
//      below specifically detects an all-0xFF-fresh table and resets it to
//      a clean all-zero table instead, so the feature actually works the
//      first time in this emulator - documented here rather than silently
//      patched in, per this task's own "document uncertainty" instruction.
//
// TWO SMALLER REAL QUIRKS FOUND, HANDLED DIFFERENTLY ON PURPOSE:
//
//   - `stepPregame()`'s own `stage = 255; ...; nextStage();` is a
//     deliberate real trick (upstream's own comment literally says "Reset
//     to stage 0"): since `stage` is `uint8_t` on real hardware, incrementing
//     255 wraps around to 0 inside `nextStage()`'s own `stage++`. This
//     shim's `armaStage` is a plain unbounded `int` (matching every other
//     ported game's own `byte`/`uint8_t` -> `int` treatment), which would
//     NOT wrap the same way - `armaStage = -1;` is used instead right
//     before calling `armaNextStage()`, producing the exact same real
//     result (a fresh stage 0) without needing to fake an 8-bit overflow
//     this shim's own wider `int` doesn't have.
//   - `drawLull()`'s own `for( uint8_t i; i < 8; i++ )` loop never
//     initializes `i` at all - a genuine uninitialized-variable bug on real
//     hardware (undefined behavior in C, though AVR-GCC's own real codegen
//     most likely just happened to leave it reading 0 from a reused
//     register/stack slot in practice). Unlike the two EEPROM bugs above,
//     relying on genuinely uninitialized memory has no well-defined
//     behavior to even preserve in a *different* runtime - `armaUpdatePregame()`'s
//     ported equivalent (the cityCount tally inside `armaDrawLull()`)
//     explicitly initializes its own loop counter to 0, the overwhelmingly
//     likely real intended behavior, rather than reading whatever garbage
//     this shim's own runtime happens to leave behind.
//
// `#define MAX_CHANCE 50` is real upstream dead code - defined once, never
// referenced anywhere in any of the three files (the only place that could
// have used it, a `stage`-scaled `echance` formula, is itself commented out
// in `tryLaunchEnemy()`, leaving `echance` permanently fixed at its real
// initial value of 1 for the whole game) - dropped outright here rather
// than ported as dead weight, matching gameConduit.c's own identical
// treatment of its own dead `count` debug variable. `echance`'s own
// permanently-fixed value of 1 is, however, real load-bearing (if oddly
// undynamic) behavior and IS preserved exactly as upstream shipped it.
//
// Explicit `(int)` casts were added at every float-to-int drawing-call
// boundary this dialect requires but real C++ did implicitly (missile
// positions are tracked as `float` throughout, exactly like upstream, but
// `gbDrawLine()`/`gbDrawPixel()`/`gbDrawCircle()` all take `int` - the same
// treatment gameCatcher.c's own sprite-position casts already established).
//
// SHIM GAPS: none found beyond the already-documented, deliberately
// out-of-scope on-screen keyboard text entry above - every other primitive
// this port needed (`gbDrawBitmap`, `gbRepeat`, `gbDrawChar`'s underlying
// `gbPrintString`, `eeprom_read_byte`/`eeprom_write_byte`, `atan2`/`cos`/
// `sin`/`sqrt` via the globally-included `math.h`, and now the real sound
// command/tracker engine) already existed and worked as documented.
