// Crabator (Rodot, license: none specified upstream - github.com/Rodot/
// Crabator). A top-down twin-stick-style shooter on a toroidal (wrapping)
// 16x12 tile world: kill crabs for cash, spend $5 at a roaming crate to
// upgrade through 5 weapons (.357/P90/AK47/RPG/MG42), survive an
// ever-growing crab population (a periodic tougher "boss" crab spawns every
// few kills, the interval shrinking over time) for as long as possible.
// Upstream's own readme describes it plainly: "kill crabs to make money to
// buy weapons to kill crabs to make money, etc."
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site is mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment - this
// dialect has no classes/methods). Every global/function got a `crab`-
// prefixed name (this cartridge has one flat namespace across 43 other
// already-ported games). `byte`/`char`/`boolean` all became plain `int`/
// `bool` (no byte-width types in this dialect); `int16_t`/`uint8_t`
// parameters became plain `int`. `random(N)` -> `arand(N)`; `random(a,b)`
// (Arduino's own exclusive-upper-bound ranged form) -> `a + arand(b - a)`.
// `PROGMEM`/`pgm_read_byte()` are dropped outright (already no-ops in this
// shim - see avrCompat.h). `switch(dir)`/`switch(gb.menu(...))` both became
// if/else-if chains (this port's own established caution around this
// dialect's switch support, even though several already-shipped games do
// use `switch` successfully - matching gameShipwrek.c/gameUfoRace.c's own
// choice here). Real C++ reference parameters (`int&`, `byte&` in
// `screenCoord()`/`moveXYDS()`) have no equivalent in this dialect -
// `screenCoord()` became an int* out-parameter pair (the same b2Vec2-style
// "out-pointer" idiom this project's own VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md documents,
// already proven here via gameSkibuino.c's own `skiGetSpriteWH()`);
// `moveXYDS()`'s `x`/`y` out-params became a `crabMoveXYDS(int* x, int* y,
// int dir, int speed)` signature, with every array-element call site
// (mobs/bullets) using a local copy-in/copy-out pair rather than taking a
// direct `&array[i]` address, purely as a defensive, unnecessary-risk-
// avoidance choice (address-of a plain scalar, e.g. `&crabPlayerX`, is used
// directly since that's a proven-safe pattern already).
//
// MULTI-TAB CONSOLIDATION: upstream ships 7 real .ino tabs (Crabator.ino,
// bullets.ino, crate.ino, mobs.ino, pause_menu.ino, play.ino, sprites.ino,
// world.ino - Arduino concatenates them alphabetically into one real
// translation unit, exactly like every other multi-tab game already ported
// here). Reordered here (world -> splash/bullets helpers -> mobs -> bullets/
// shooting -> crate -> score/EEPROM -> state machine) purely so every
// function is defined before its first real call site in this dialect's
// single top-to-bottom translation unit (no forward prototypes needed) -
// `mobs.ino`'s own `damageMob()` calls `bullets.ino`'s own `setSplash()`,
// for instance, so the bullets/splash helpers had to move earlier. This is
// a pure reordering, not a behavior change.
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED VERBATIM: all 10 real PROGMEM bitmaps from
// sprites.ino (the 64x36 `logo`, the 16x12-bit `world` tile bitmask, the
// 8x8 `tiles`/`mobSprite`/`bossSprite`/`playerSprite`/`splashSprite`/
// `crateSprite`/`fullHeart`/`halfHeart`/`emptyHeart`) were converted from
// upstream's own real `B########`-style Arduino binary literals to this
// project's own `0x` hex convention via a one-off Python script that
// parsed sprites.ino directly and converted every literal byte-for-byte
// (not hand-transcribed or guessed), matching this project's own
// established precedent (gameShipwrek.c/gameUfoRace.c). Every real
// `gb.display.drawBitmap(...)` call site has a direct `gbDrawBitmap()`/
// `gbDrawBitmapRotated()` counterpart - checked for the "upstream draws a
// mask/fill layer first" bleed-through bug class this project's own
// history warns about, and it does NOT apply here: every one of these 10
// sprites is a complete, self-contained tile/icon drawn onto a screen
// `gbUpdate()` has just freshly cleared, with nothing else underneath to
// bleed through.
//
// STATE MACHINE CONVERSION: upstream's real control flow is a nest of
// blocking calls - `setup()` shows a real blocking `gb.titleScreen(logo)`
// once, then calls `initGame()`; `loop()` (called repeatedly by the Arduino
// runtime) immediately calls `pause()` (a real blocking `gb.menu(...)`-
// driven pause menu, NOT gameplay), which dispatches via `switch` to
// `play()` (itself a blocking `while(true)` loop, exited only by a real
// Button-C press), `displayHighScores()`, or a small blocking System Info
// loop. All of this was flattened into an explicit `CrabState` enum
// (TITLE/MENU/PLAY/HIGHSCORES/SYSINFO) dispatched from
// `gameCrabator_update()`, matching the "blocking loop -> explicit
// resumable state" treatment used throughout this project (see
// gamePong.c's own header comment). `CRAB_STATE_PLAY` itself has 4 real
// sub-phases (`CrabPlayPhase`) mirroring upstream's own real internal
// structure exactly: `CRAB_PLAY_INTRO` (`play()`'s own real "LET'S GO!"
// countdown, `i<10`, fontSize 2, run once every real `play()` call),
// `CRAB_PLAY_NORMAL` (the real main `while(true){ if(gb.update()){...} }`
// body), `CRAB_PLAY_GAMEOVER_ANIM` (the real white-wipe-bars-closing-in
// `while(1)` block, `timer` 0 to `LCDWIDTH/4+10`), and
// `CRAB_PLAY_GAMEOVER_STATS` (the real final "GAME OVER!"/"NEW HIGHSCORE"
// + stats `while(1)` block, waiting for Button A).
//
// TWO GENUINE, SUBTLE UPSTREAM QUIRKS PRESERVED IN THE STATE MACHINE:
// 1. Upstream's real `pause()` switch has an asymmetry in how its cases
//    exit: case 0 ("Play") and case 2/3/4 all `break` (looping back to
//    re-show the SAME pause menu once `play()`/the sub-screen returns),
//    but case 1 ("Restart") ends with a real `return;` - exiting `pause()`
//    entirely, so control falls through to `loop()`'s own trailing
//    `gb.titleScreen(logo);` call (a real blocking title-screen wait for a
//    fresh A-press) BEFORE the pause menu is ever seen again. So pressing
//    Button C mid-game after choosing "Play" returns straight to the pause
//    menu, but after choosing "Restart" it detours through the title splash
//    first. Ported via `crabPlayCReturnsTo` (set to `CRAB_STATE_MENU` for
//    "Play", `CRAB_STATE_TITLE` for "Restart" - and `CRAB_STATE_TITLE` is
//    ALWAYS dismissed by a fresh A-press straight back into
//    `CRAB_STATE_MENU`, matching every real path that shows the title
//    splash mid-session: the initial boot, this "Restart" quirk, the
//    "Main Menu" pause item, and Button C cancelling the pause menu itself
//    - real upstream's own `default: return;` case in the same switch,
//    interpreted here as this dialect's own explicit Button-C-cancels
//    gesture since no real `gb.menu()` cancel semantics could be confirmed
//    directly).
// 2. "Play" (case 0) never calls `initGame()` - it just resumes whatever
//    game state already exists - while "Restart" (case 1) always calls
//    `initGame()` first. Both call `play()`, and `play()`'s own real
//    "LET'S GO!" intro + `gb.popup("\x15:shoot \x16:run", 60)` hint run
//    ONCE at the very top of every real `play()` call, unconditionally -
//    but a death-triggered in-place restart (the real `initGame(); break;`
//    at the end of the game-over stats screen, which breaks only the inner
//    `for(thisMob...)` loop, never actually returning from `play()` itself)
//    stays inside the SAME `play()` call and therefore never replays the
//    intro. Ported via `crabMenuSelectPlay()`/`crabMenuSelectRestart()`
//    (both set `crabPlayPhase = CRAB_PLAY_INTRO`) vs. the game-over-stats
//    accept handler and `crabDismissHighscores()`'s own "continue" branch
//    (both set `crabPlayPhase = CRAB_PLAY_NORMAL` directly, skipping the
//    intro).
//
// EEPROM - A REAL HIGHSCORE CONSUMER: upstream's own `loadHighscore()`/
// `saveHighscore()` genuinely call `EEPROM.read()`/`EEPROM.write()` (a real
// top-5 table, RANKMAX=5) - ported via this shim's own `eeprom_read_byte()`/
// `eeprom_write_byte()` (2 bytes/entry, LSB then MSB, 5 entries - simpler
// than upstream's own real 12-bytes/entry layout, which also packs a
// 10-character name per entry; only upstream's real *behavior*, a
// persisted, sorted score table, needs to survive a reboot here, not a
// bit-for-bit-identical EEPROM layout, matching this project's own
// established norm). Upstream's own real fresh-EEPROM sentinel handling -
// `highscore[i] = (highscore[i]==0xFFFF) ? 0 : highscore[i];` - already
// matches this shim's own real fresh-EEPROM behavior (unwritten cells read
// as 0xFF, so a fresh entry decodes to exactly 0xFFFF) with zero adaptation
// needed, unlike gameUfoRace.c's own different lower-is-better 9999
// sentinel choice for a lap-time table.
//
// NAME ENTRY - DROPPED, DOCUMENTED: upstream's own `gb.getDefaultName(...)`
// + `gb.keyboard(...)` (a real on-screen text-entry widget, called from
// `saveHighscore()` right before it shows the highscore table) has no
// equivalent anywhere in this shim (no on-screen-keyboard primitive exists
// at all) - dropped entirely, matching gameUfoRace.c's/gameShipwrek.c's own
// identical precedent: `crabHighscore[]` is a plain numeric-only table, no
// name column at all, rather than a fabricated placeholder name.
//
// SOUND - REAL, FULL RESTORATION: upstream's own real `Sound::
// playPattern()` calls (the per-weapon fire sound - `magnum_sound`/
// `p90_sound`/`ak47_sound`/`rpg_sound`/`mg42_sound` plus the P90's own
// `p90_alternative_sound` - and `blast_sound`, `mob_death_sound`,
// `player_damage_sound`, `power_up`) are ported verbatim onto this shim's
// real pattern-engine primitive (`gbPlayPattern()`), not approximated -
// every real upstream tracker-envelope hex/decimal value was copied
// byte-for-byte from `Crabator.ino` into a `crab*Sound` array here (each
// array's own element count, including its real 0x0000 terminator, was
// checked against upstream's own literal array before trusting it), and
// all 7 real upstream `playPattern()` call sites (weapon fire, the P90
// alternate waveform, x2 blast, mob death, player damage, power-up) are
// restored - none dropped. `weapons_sounds[]` (a real PROGMEM array of
// PROGMEM pointers upstream) is ported as an if/else lookup function,
// `crabWeaponSoundFor()`, returning the matching pattern array directly -
// the same treatment `crabWeaponName()` above already uses for the
// analogous `weapon_name[]` array-of-string-pointers, since a genuine
// `int*[N]` array-of-array-pointers remains unverified in this dialect
// (see that function's own comment). Every real call uses channel 0,
// matching upstream exactly - upstream never calls `changePatternSet()`/
// `changeInstrumentSet()` anywhere in this game, so channel 0 keeps this
// shim's own real default square+noise instrument pair throughout, same
// as real hardware's own default. Upstream's own real per-tick throttle
// for the two automatic weapons (`if(((currentWeapon==1)||(currentWeapon
// ==4))&&(gb.frameCount%2)){ /* skip */ } else { playPattern(...); }` -
// silences the fire sound on every other real tick for P90/MG42, to
// avoid a continuous-beep effect) and the P90-specific
// `p90_alternative_sound` cancel-every-other-shot waveform swap
// (`if(currentWeapon==1){ if(random()%2) playPattern(p90_alternative_
// sound,0); }`, ported as `arand(2)`) are both restored exactly.
//
// SYSTEM INFO - PARTIALLY HONEST, PARTIALLY REAL: upstream's own System
// Info pause-menu screen reads real hardware telemetry this shim has no
// equivalent for at all (`gb.battery.voltage/level`, `gb.backlight.
// ambientLight/backlightValue`, `gb.sound.getVolume()/volumeMax`) - shown
// here as a short, honest "No sensors emulated here" placeholder instead
// of fabricated numbers, matching gameUfoRace.c's own established
// precedent for the same situation. Unlike that game, though, upstream's
// own System Info screen ALSO prints two real, available-here values
// (`activeMobs`/`NUMMOBS`, `kills`) - those two lines are genuine, live
// data in this port too, not placeholders.
//
// OTHER REAL QUIRKS FOUND, PRESERVED (not "fixed") - fidelity to upstream:
// - `crabBlastBullet` (upstream `blast_bullet`) is a single shared global
//   set UNCONDITIONALLY by every real call to `shoot()` (any weapon, not
//   just the RPG) - so if a different weapon is fired while an earlier RPG
//   round is still in flight, that RPG's own eventual AOE explosion damage/
//   recoil (`damageMob(thisMob, blast_bullet)` inside `explode()`) can end
//   up using the LATER weapon's own damage/recoil stats instead of the
//   RPG's own. A genuine, if obscure, real upstream quirk (not a porting
//   mistake), preserved verbatim rather than tracking a per-explosion
//   weapon id upstream itself never bothered to.
// - The life-hearts drawing loop (`for(i=0; i<=playerLifeMax/2; i+=1)`)
//   always burns one throwaway iteration at `i==0` that draws entirely
//   off-screen (`LCDWIDTH - 0*9 + 2 = 86 > LCDWIDTH`) before the 3 real
//   visible heart icons at `i==1,2,3` - preserved exactly (not "fixed" into
//   starting at `i==1`), a real, harmless upstream artifact.
// - `crabResetGameState()` (upstream `initGame()`) never resets
//   `playerDir`/`playerSpeed`/`shake_magnitude` - only the exact fields
//   upstream's own real `initGame()` resets are reset here too.
// - `cameraY = playerY - LCDHEIGHT/2 + playerW/2;` reuses `playerW` (not
//   `playerH`) for the Y-axis offset in upstream's own real `initGame()` -
//   inert here since `playerW == playerH == 6`, but ported literally
//   (`CRAB_PLAYER_W`, not `CRAB_PLAYER_H`) rather than "corrected."
// - Upstream's own real `byteWidth = (WORLD_H + 7) / 8` sizes a per-row
//   byte stride off the map's HEIGHT constant where it should logically
//   depend on its WIDTH (16 columns = 2 bytes/row) - numerically identical
//   here only because `(12+7)/8` also truncates to 2, so this is a real but
//   totally inert upstream mismatch for these exact dimensions. Ported as a
//   fixed `CRAB_BYTE_WIDTH` constant (not the misleading formula itself,
//   which would wrongly suggest the map's real per-row byte stride tracks
//   its height).
// - `explode()`'s own real `random(-4,4)` (Arduino's exclusive-upper-bound
//   ranged form, giving the asymmetric range [-4,3], not a symmetric
//   [-4,4]) is ported as the equivalent `-4 + arand(8)` - preserving the
//   real asymmetry rather than "rounding it out" to a symmetric range.
// - Upstream's own `assignArray()` (declared in Crabator.ino) is never
//   called anywhere in the source actually read for this port - dropped
//   outright as real, provably-dead code, matching this project's own
//   established norm (e.g. gameShipwrek.c's own dropped `uselessN`
//   globals).
// - `shakeScreen()`'s own real backlight-flicker line (`gb.backlight.
//   set(...)`) was dropped outright - no backlight primitive exists
//   anywhere in this shim (a real-hardware-only cosmetic feature, the same
//   treatment `gb.battery.show` already got in gamePong.c).
