// Elventure - ported from the real Gamebuino Classic "Elventure" cartridge.
//
// Source: https://github.com/wuuff/Elventure (this project's own staged
// copy: "more games/Elventure/"). Real original game (2011-2013) by
// trodoss, published by TEAM a.r.g. (http://www.team-arg.org/) - the real
// "Original by TEAM ARG." credit line the real upstream `setup()` itself
// prints via `gb.titleScreen(F("Original by TEAM ARG.\nPort by Wuff."),
// title_bitmap_unified)`. This specific Gamebuino Classic port/build (the
// one actually staged here) is itself already a port-of-a-port: the real
// git history (`git log`) shows a single real commit by "wuuff"
// (wuuuufff@gmail.com), the same real author already credited elsewhere in
// this project for CrazyCar/Armageddon/Crabator/UFO Race. License: GPLv3
// (`more games/Elventure/LICENSE`) - note the real header comment inside
// `more games/Elventure/ELV_TV_v10.ino` itself instead says "version 2 of
// the License, or (at your option) any later version", a real, pre-existing
// discrepancy between the checked-in top-level LICENSE file (GPLv3) and the
// per-file header text (GPLv2-or-later) - not introduced by this port,
// flagged here the same way this project's own README already flags a
// similar real GPLv2/GPLv3 concern for `gameFiremen.c`.
//
// WHAT THIS GAME IS: a real, top-down Zelda-like action-adventure - a
// single elf character explores a 128-room (8 columns x 16 rows), scrolling
// overworld/underworld map one screen-sized room at a time, fighting real
// roaming monsters with a throwable sword, collecting hearts (health) and 4
// real quest items (crystal/orb/armor/staff) from fixed per-room locations,
// with two real portals linking the overworld (rooms 64-127) and
// underworld (rooms 0-63) halves of the map. Collecting any 3 of the 4 real
// quest items wins the game.
//
// REAL CLASS FLATTENING: real upstream is genuine class-based C++ (`Elf`/
// `RoomElement`/`Display` structs plus free functions taking them by value/
// reference across `elf.cpp`/`monster.cpp`/`item.cpp`/`room.cpp`/`map.cpp`/
// `display.cpp`/`logo.cpp`/`sound.cpp`) - flattened here into:
//   - `Elf`      -> plain scalar globals (`elvElfFacing`/`Step`/`X`/`Y`/
//     `Hearts`/`State` plus a separate `int[4] elvElfItems` global array) -
//     only one instance ever exists, and this dialect's own array-typed-
//     struct-member support is unproven (flagged directly by
//     `gamebuino-solitaire`'s own header comment earlier this project), so
//     the inventory array was kept as an independent global rather than a
//     struct field, sidestepping the open question entirely rather than
//     being the one to test it.
//   - `RoomElement` (real upstream's own already-class-free plain struct,
//     used for the sword/monsters/items in the current room, max 4 at
//     once) -> `struct ElvRoomElement { type,x,y,state,step,counter }`
//     (scalar fields only) plus `ElvRoomElement[4] elvRoomElements` - the
//     proven `Type[N] name;` array-of-named-struct pattern already shipped
//     by `gameSuperSpaceShooter.c`'s own `SssBullet[64] sssBullets`. Real
//     upstream's own `id` field (which just mirrored a `RoomElement`'s own
//     array slot number back to itself) was dropped outright - every
//     function here takes an explicit array index instead of a struct
//     copy, the same "index instead of by-value struct" treatment this
//     project has used since `gamePunkt.c`, which sidesteps real
//     upstream's own pervasive "function takes/returns a `RoomElement` by
//     value" shape entirely (a 6-field struct return is >1 word, illegal
//     here per VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md #4 - `hitElf()`/`hitMonster()`/
//     `moveMonster()`/`moveItem()`/`hitItem()`/`getRoomElement()` all
//     returned one). `elvHandleRoomElements()`'s own real "monster killed
//     mid-loop adds a heart, which the same real per-room-load `while
//     (element_count < MAX_ELEMENT_RECORDS)` cap already guarantees never
//     overflows the real 4-slot array (verified by hand: every one of the
//     128 real rooms only ever seeds at most 1 custom element beyond the
//     always-present sword, since `room_element_data`'s own real 4th quad
//     field is *always* 255 - a real, always-true per-room terminator, not
//     a sometime one - so a room can reach at most 3 live elements
//     (sword + 1 spawned + 1 heart-on-kill), never the 4-slot ceiling)"
//     quirk is preserved by re-reading the real, global `elvElementCount`
//     bound on every loop iteration, exactly like real upstream's own
//     `for (i=0; i<element_count; i++)`.
//   - `Map`/`Room` (mostly free functions already, no real class state
//     beyond one `map_curr_room` global) -> `elvMapCurrRoom` global plus
//     `elvGetMapBlock()`/`elvCheckMapRoomMove()`/`elvScrollMap()`/
//     `elvSetMapRoom()`/`elvLoadRoomElements()` free functions, ported
//     near-verbatim.
//   - `Display` (this game's own `display.cpp`/`bitmap_funcs.cpp`, real
//     files distinct from the real Gamebuino Display class - see the
//     dedicated section below) -> folded into `elvDrawHud()`/
//     `elvDrawFrame()` directly on top of this shim's own already-existing
//     `gbDrawBitmap()`/`gbFillRect()` primitives, nothing new needed.
//   - `Logo`/`Sound` -> `elvDrawLogo()` (near-verbatim) and dropped
//     entirely (see the real dead-code finding below).
// CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY, RESOLVED FOR FREE: real upstream's own `room.cpp`
// needs `elf.h`/`item.h`/`monster.h`, `elf.cpp` needs `room.h`/`item.h`,
// `monster.cpp`/`item.cpp` both need `map.h`/`room.h` - a real mutual-
// include web only possible in real C++ via forward-declared header
// prototypes across many translation units. Flattening every one of those
// real classes into this single one-file, one-translation-unit port
// (`src/main.c` #includes exactly one `.c` per game, matching every other
// game in this cartridge) makes the "circular dependency" question moot
// entirely: every function below is just declared in a straightforward
// dependency order (small self-contained helpers first, `elvHandleRoomElements()`
// last among the logic functions, `elvDrawFrame()` last of all) with no
// forward prototypes needed anywhere, the same "it's all one file now"
// resolution already used by every multi-class game shipped in this
// cartridge before this one.
//
// REAL `display.cpp`/`bitmap_funcs.cpp` CONFIRMED TO CONTAIN NO CUSTOM
// PER-PIXEL BITMAP-MASKING CODE - checked directly and carefully per this
// batch's own explicit instruction to verify this rather than assume it,
// given the real, serious performance bug a sibling game in this same
// batch of Tier-3 RPG ports hit from exactly this class of mistake (see
// this project's own "Pirates ported, then reverted" section). Reading
// `bitmap_funcs.cpp`'s real `overlaybitmap()`/`erasebitmap()`/
// `eraseBitmapRect()` bodies directly shows every one of them is a *real,
// already-dead* hand-rolled per-pixel/per-byte TVout compositing routine,
// entirely wrapped in a `/* ... */` block comment (a leftover from this
// same file's own prior life as part of the unrelated "Parachute" hackvision
// sketch it was borrowed from, credited in this game's own real header
// comment) - the actual, live, compiled body of all three functions is
// nothing but a single direct call straight through to real
// `gb.display.drawBitmap()`/`fillRect()`/`setColor()`, i.e. this shim's own
// already-optimized `gbDrawBitmap()`/`gbFillRect()`/`gbSetColor()`
// primitives are a exact, direct, already-fast drop-in replacement with
// zero custom per-pixel code needed or written by this port at all. Real
// `display.cpp`'s own `updateDisplay()` is likewise nothing but a sequence
// of `gb.display.drawBitmap()`/`eraseBitmapRect()` calls (the real HUD
// heart/item icons) - ported directly the same way, see `elvDrawHud()`.
//
// A DELIBERATE, DOCUMENTED RENDERING-STRATEGY CHANGE (not a gameplay
// change): real upstream sets `gb.display.persistence = true` and then
// hand-manages exactly which small regions get erased/redrawn each tick
// (an old-AVR-hardware CPU optimization: only the ~2-4 sprites that moved
// this tick get touched, not the other ~56 already-correct map tiles) -
// this shim's own `gbUpdate()` unconditionally clears the whole framebuffer
// every real logic tick instead (matching real hardware's own *default*
// `persistence=false` behavior, the same default every other game in this
// cartridge already relies on). Unlike `gameTron.c` (this cartridge's one
// other real `persistence=true` game), Elventure's own real incremental-
// erase/redraw scheme is *purely* a CPU-cost optimization, never a source
// of truth a later read depends on - real upstream never once reads pixels
// back from the framebuffer for game logic (`checkMapRoomMove()` reads the
// real `map_room_data`/`map_pattern_data` tables directly, not
// `getPixel()`), unlike Tron's own real trail-collision mechanic, which
// generally *requires* true persistence since the drawn trail pixels
// themselves are the only record of where every rider has already been.
// So this port simply redraws the *entire* current room (all 60 real 8x8
// map tiles), the real HUD, the elf, and every live room element fresh
// every single tick (`elvDrawFrame()`, called once per tick from
// `elvUpdatePlaying()`) instead of reproducing real upstream's own
// incremental erase-old/draw-new bookkeeping - provably the same final
// on-screen pixels every tick either way (a full redraw already draws the
// correct map tile under a sprite's old position directly, the same
// pixels real upstream's own explicit `eraseBitmapRect()` call would have
// restored first), and trivially affordable at real upstream's own
// deliberately slow `gb.setFrameRate(10)` (10fps) - about 60-70 real
// `gbDrawBitmap()` calls/tick, nowhere near this dialect's real ~250,000-
// instruction/frame budget at 60fps, let alone 10fps. Every draw call in
// `elvDrawFrame()`/`elvDrawHud()`/`elvDrawLogo()` is a single already-
// optimized shim primitive call (`gbDrawBitmap()`/`gbFillRect()`), never a
// per-pixel loop, so this simplification is also strictly cheaper than a
// faithfully-incremental port would have been, not just simpler to write.
//
// REAL SOUND SYSTEM (`sound.cpp`/`sound_data.h`) IS DEAD CODE IN THE REAL
// SHIPPED BUILD, CONFIRMED BY READING IT DIRECTLY: real `play_song(char
// song)` has a literal `return;` as its very first executable statement,
// with an adjacent real upstream comment removing all doubt this is
// deliberate: "//NOTE EARLY RETURN!! Currently NOT playing any music." -
// meaning the entire real melody/tempo/duration/song_start pattern-player
// data and the `play_song()`/`play_song_once()`/`update_sound()`/
// `play_sfx()` functions built on top of it never actually produce sound
// in the real, already-shipped cartridge this port is translating (traced
// by hand: `play_song_once()` still unconditionally sets `music_state =
// SONG_PLAYING_ONCE` even though the `play_song()` call right before it
// already returned early, so `update_sound()` does fire exactly one real
// `gb.sound.playNote()` call with a genuinely computed `0`-tick duration
// the very first tick after a game-over/won screen appears, then falls
// permanently idle - a real, but functionally silent/inaudible artifact of
// dead code, not real music). This port drops the entire melody/tempo/
// duration data tables and the `play_song()`/`play_song_once()`/
// `update_sound()`/`play_sfx()` functions outright, matching the real
// shipped cartridge's own actual audible behavior exactly: zero music
// ever plays, matching this project's own already-documented, already-
// accepted "only one-shot representative tones ported, no pattern/track
// player" scope limit (see the main project CLAUDE.md's own "Open
// questions" section). The four real one-shot SFX calls this game
// actually does make audible use of - `gb.sound.playCancel()` (hit by a
// monster), `gb.sound.playTick()` (heart collected), `gb.sound.playOK()`
// (quest item collected) - are real, live, direct calls (NOT routed
// through the dead song system at all) and are ported directly via
// `gbPlayCancel()`/`gbPlayTick()`/`gbPlayOK()`. Real upstream's own
// `gb.sound.command(1,0,0,0)` (a real jukebox-channel-enable call, made
// once in `start_game()`) has no equivalent primitive in this shim at all
// - dropped outright, since it only ever configured the same dead song
// system anyway, so dropping it changes nothing observable.
//
// NO FACING/FLIP-DEPENDENT COLLISION ANYWHERE IN THIS GAME - checked
// directly per this batch's own explicit instruction, given a sibling
// game in this same batch hit a real, serious pre-existing upstream bug
// from exactly this class of mistake (see "Pirates ported, then reverted"
// again). Real `testRoomElement()`'s own hitbox test always uses the same
// fixed `(x, x+8)` / `(y, y+ySize)` axis-aligned rectangle regardless of
// which way the elf is currently facing, and the elf's own 12 sprite
// frames (`elf_bitmap.cpp`) are 12 genuinely *separate*, hand-drawn images
// (one full frame per facing x per animation step) rather than one base
// frame reused via `gbDrawBitmapRotated()`'s own rotate/flip parameters -
// this port never calls `gbDrawBitmapRotated()` at all, only plain
// `gbDrawBitmap()`, so there is no rotation/flip-vs-hitbox mismatch to get
// wrong in the first place.
//
// NO REAL SAVE/PERSISTENCE CONCEPT - confirmed by a direct
// `grep -rn "EEPROM\|eeprom"` across all 36 real staged source files,
// zero matches. Real upstream never includes `<EEPROM.h>` and has no
// highscore/progress-save mechanic of any kind (death/victory both just
// restart the same fixed 3-heart/no-inventory run) - no EEPROM wiring
// added here, matching real shipped behavior exactly (nothing to persist).
//
// REAL UPSTREAM QUIRKS PRESERVED DELIBERATELY (bugs/oddities, not fixed):
//   - `elvScrollMap()`'s own DOWN/RIGHT bounds checks are only ever
//     `< ELV_MAP_ROOM_COUNT` (128), never guarded against overshooting the
//     *edge* of the map's own real 8-wide/16-tall grid (e.g. scrolling
//     LEFT from a room at the start of a row silently wraps into the
//     *previous* row's own rightmost room, and DOWN from the bottom row
//     can reach room 128-135, one row past the real 1280-entry
//     `elvMapRoomData` table) - ported byte-for-byte from real upstream's
//     own identical, equally unguarded `scrollMap()` (confirmed against
//     `map.cpp` directly), on the same reasoning already established by
//     this project's own `gameUfoRace.c` for an analogous unguarded
//     `getTile()`: real map *design* (the outer boundary of the whole
//     128-room grid being walled) almost certainly keeps a real player
//     from ever reaching the edge case in practice, and even if it were
//     reached, an out-of-bounds *read* is not a hard-trap on this
//     platform (VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md section 17.3's own list of what
//     does hard-trap - div/mod-by-zero, `sqrt` of a negative, `atan2(0,0)`
//     - does not include a plain array read), so the worst realistic
//     outcome is a garbage-tiled room, never a crash.
//   - `elvHitElf()`'s own monster-contact "bounce" (flip the monster's
//     movement direction to the opposite one) fires on *every* tick the
//     elf and a live monster's hitboxes overlap, not just the tick a
//     heart is actually lost (the heart-loss/invulnerability-counter gate
//     is a separate, inner check) - ported exactly as real upstream's own
//     `hitElf()` structures it.
//   - Picking up any 3 items (not necessarily 3 *distinct* quest item
//     types) wins the game, per real upstream's own literal
//     `addElfItem()` slot-counting logic - preserved exactly (in practice
//     each of the 4 real quest items only ever spawns once across the
//     whole 128-room map per real `room_element_data`, so this distinction
//     is real but never actually observable in a normal playthrough).
//
// REAL BITMAP/DATA TABLES EXTRACTED VERBATIM, NOT HAND-TRANSCRIBED: every
// one of `elf_bitmap.cpp`/`item_bitmap.cpp`/`monster_bitmap.cpp`/
// `map_bitmap.cpp`/`logo_bitmap.cpp`/`display_bitmap.cpp` (plus
// `title_bitmap_unified`, the one real bitmap `other_bitmap.h` actually
// contributes - its own `team_arg_bitmap`/`logo2_bitmap` are real, but
// dead: only ever reached through commented-out `TV.bitmap()` calls, never
// a live `gb.display.drawBitmap()` one, so neither was ported) and
// `map_data.h`/`room_data.h` were parsed and converted by a small Python
// script directly from the real source text (comments stripped first, so
// a real in-line comment like `//Moved from x=40, y=24 ...` couldn't be
// mistaken for array data by a naive comma-split), every `0b...`-style
// Arduino binary literal converted to `0x` hex (this dialect has no binary
// literal syntax, the same conversion this project's own `gameArmageddon.c`/
// `gameSpinSpinSpinbuino.c` already needed), and every resulting record's
// real byte count cross-checked against its own declared width/height
// header (`2 + ceil(width/8)*height`) before being trusted - every single
// one matched exactly (12 elf frames, 14 item frames, 9 monster frames, 7
// map-tile frames, 12 logo frames, 6 HUD-icon frames, 210
// `map_pattern_data` entries, 1280 `map_room_data` entries, 128
// `room_element_index_data` entries, 196 `room_element_data` entries - all
// matching their own real declared `#define` counts in `map_data.h`/
// `room_data.h` exactly). Each bitmap frame is its own named `int[N]`
// array (`elvElfBmp0`..`elvElfBmp11` etc), collected into an
// `int*[N] elvXBitmaps = { ... };` lookup array indexed by the real
// upstream frame-offset formula (e.g. `elvElfBitmaps[facing]`/
// `[facing+step]`) - the same proven "array of bitmap pointers, indexed"
// pattern already shipped by `gameGlaciGlaca.c`'s own `glaciGoutSprite`/
// `gameArtillery.c`'s own `artUnitsBitmaps`, chosen deliberately over raw
// pointer-arithmetic into one flat blob (real upstream's own
// `elf_bitmap + (facing * SIZEOF_ELF_RECORD)` idiom) to avoid needing to
// re-derive the exact per-record word offset by hand for every one of the
// 6 bitmap tables.
//
// TITLE/PAUSE SCREEN TEXT, ADAPTED: real upstream's own single blocking
// `gb.titleScreen(text, bitmap)` call (used both at boot and, with
// different text, as a mid-game Button-C pause) draws its passed-in logo
// at real hardware's own fixed `(0, 12)` anchor (confirmed against real
// `Gamebuino.cpp` during this project's own earlier `gameArmageddon.c`/
// `gameUfoRace.c` ports of the exact same real library function) - reused
// here unchanged for both `elvUpdateBootTitle()`/`elvUpdatePauseTitle()`.
// The real credit text ("Original by TEAM ARG." / "Port by Wuff.") is
// slightly shortened to fit this shim's own smallest real font
// (`gbFont3x5`) within the real 84px screen width, matching this
// project's own already-established precedent (`gameCrazyCar.c`/
// `gameConduit.c` both already shortened real upstream text for the exact
// same reason) - the real names/roles are kept intact, only the
// surrounding words are dropped. The real pause hint text's own icon
// escape (`"Press \25 to resume."` - a real octal `\25` = decimal 21,
// this project's own already-established "A button" icon glyph, the same
// one `gameTaquin.c`/`gameSimonbuino.c`/`gameSpinSpinSpinbuino.c` already
// restored for an identical real upstream icon reference) is reproduced
// as a real `gbDrawChar(21, ...)` call spliced between two `gbPrintString()`
// calls (rather than a hand-built `int[]` array, since `gbPrintString()`
// already exposes `gbCursorX`/`gbFontWidth` for exactly this splice).
//
// A DELIBERATE, MINOR RENDERING-TIMING SIMPLIFICATION: real upstream's own
// mid-game pause is a genuinely *blocking* call - the instant Button C is
// pressed, `gb.titleScreen()` itself loops internally (calling `gb.update()`
// over and over) until Button A is pressed, then the *same* real Arduino
// `loop()` iteration immediately redraws the full map/HUD/elf and resumes
// `handleRoomElements()` before that iteration ends. This port instead
// models PAUSE as an explicit state (`ELV_GS_PAUSE`, matching this
// project's own established "blocking widget -> explicit resumable state"
// treatment, e.g. `gamePong.c`'s own `PONG_STATE_TITLE`) - dismissing it
// (Button A) simply returns to `ELV_GS_PLAYING`, whose very next real tick
// (100ms later at this game's own 10fps) redraws the room and resumes
// monster/item movement, rather than resuming within the exact same real
// tick boundary. A harmless, single-tick (100ms) difference - gameplay
// state itself (elf position, room contents, monster positions) is
// unaffected either way, since `elvHandleRoomElements()` never runs at all
// while `ELV_GS_PAUSE` is active (monsters/items are genuinely frozen
// during the pause, matching real upstream's own real behavior exactly,
// for the same reason: `handleRoomElements()` is only ever reachable
// *after* the real blocking call returns).
