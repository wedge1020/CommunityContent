// microHexagon (valdenthoranar, license: none specified -
// bitbucket.org/valdenthoranar/microhexagon). A Super Hexagon-style
// obstacle-avoidance game: a small hexagon spins at screen center while
// walls (trapezoidal wedge segments cut from the hexagon's own 6 "lanes")
// scroll inward from the edge of the screen toward it; the player orbits
// the hexagon's perimeter (not the screen) trying to slip through the
// gaps as the walls close in, for as long as possible - the on-screen
// "TIME" readout is the score. Three .ino tabs in upstream's own real
// source (microHex.ino/player.ino/walls.ino, all one shared translation
// unit on real Arduino, exactly like this project's own single-file
// requirement) were read in full and merged into this one file.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a
// plain `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for
// why - this dialect has no classes/methods). Every global got a
// `hex`-prefixed name (no linker - every game in this cartridge shares
// one flat namespace). `random(a,b)`/`random(n)` became
// `arand(b-a)`/`arand(n)`. `char`/`byte` locals/fields all became plain
// `int` (no genuine boolean use among them - unlike gameAgaruino.c's own
// `byte`-as-boolean case). Upstream's own ternary operators (`a?b:c`,
// used twice: `random(0,2)==0 ? 1:-1` in the rotation-speed randomizer,
// and the wall-width clamp in drawWalls()) were rewritten as if/else -
// this dialect has no ternary. Upstream never calls `gb.titleScreen()`
// at all (that call is commented out in setup()) - it already implements
// its own hand-rolled MENU/GAME/GAMEOVER state machine
// (`enum GameStates`/`gmStates[]` function-pointer dispatch table), so
// there was no "blocking title screen -> explicit state" conversion
// needed here the way gamePong.c/gameConduit.c needed; ported directly as
// `HEX_STATE_MENU/PLAY/GAMEOVER` + a plain if/else dispatch in
// `gameHexagon_update()` (matching gameAgaruino.c's own established
// convention of using if/else rather than a function-pointer table, even
// though this dialect's function pointers do work - see
// VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md - for consistency with every other game in this
// project). `gb.pickRandomSeed()` is never called upstream, so there is
// nothing to port there. `gb.battery.show = false;` (setup()/playInit())
// was dropped outright, matching gamePong.c's own precedent - purely
// cosmetic on real hardware. `Serial.begin()`/the one unconditional
// `Serial.print(F("ADDING PATTERN \n"));` debug line inside upstream's
// own `updateWalls()` were dropped (no serial monitor on Vircon32,
// harmless either way). The `#ifdef DEBUG ... gb.getCpuLoad() ...`
// block in `mainGame()` was dropped too - `#define DEBUG` is commented
// out upstream, so that whole block is genuinely dead code on real
// hardware as shipped, not just here.
//
// FUNCTION ORDERING NOTE: this dialect compiles top-to-bottom in one pass
// with no forward-declared function prototypes proven anywhere else in
// this project (checked - no other ported game uses one), so every
// function below had to be reordered from upstream's own tab order to
// guarantee each is fully defined before its first call site (e.g.
// `hexInitGameOver()` had to move ahead of `hexUpdatePlayer()`, and the
// wall-pattern functions ahead of the menu/play/game-over state
// transitions that call them) - purely a file-layout concern, no
// behavioral change.
//
// STATE/DATA FLATTENING: upstream's own `_pattern`/`wall` PROGMEM-backed
// struct-copy machinery (`storePattern()` pgm_read_*-copies `wall_num`/
// `distance`/`length`/`walls` out of a constant template into one of 4
// live RAM slots) exists on real AVR only to move data out of a separate
// flash address space - meaningless on Vircon32, which has one flat
// address space (PROGMEM/pgm_read_* are no-ops here - see avrCompat.h).
// Ported as a plain small-int "which of the 6 templates is this live
// slot showing right now" index (`hexPatTemplate[4]`, -1 = none) instead
// of a live copy: `wall_num`/`length`/the wall array itself are read
// directly from the constant template tables every frame by index
// (`hexPatWallCount()`/`hexPatLength()`/`hexTemplateWallLane/Distance/
// Width()`) rather than copied at spawn time. Verified this changes
// nothing observable: `storePattern()` itself never copies `rotation`/
// `mirror` anyway (`addPatern()`/`initWalls()` always set those
// separately, immediately after/instead of calling it), so the only
// genuine per-instance state a live slot ever needs is exactly
// `distance`/`rotation`/`mirror` - precisely what `hexPatDistance[4]`/
// `hexPatRotation[4]`/`hexPatMirror[4]` store here.
//
// A genuine upstream data quirk found while transcribing the wall
// pattern tables (`wallsData.h`): pattern 4's own real wall array
// (`patt4[]`, the "Zig zag" pattern) actually contains 12 real wall
// entries, but its own `_pattern` descriptor declares `wall_num = 10` -
// only the first 10 are ever iterated by any real loop (`for (i=0;
// i<wall_num; i++)`), so the array's own last two entries are genuinely
// dead, unreachable data on real hardware too. Reproduced exactly:
// `hexPatt4[]` below still declares all 12 real entries (byte-for-byte
// transcription of the real table) but `hexWallCount[3]` (pattern 4's
// slot) is 10, matching upstream's own real `wall_num` field - the last
// two entries are dead here as well, on purpose, not a transcription
// error.
//
// A second real, preserved bug, in upstream's own `updateRoationSpeed()`
// (its own name typo, not reproduced in this port's own clean
// `hexUpdateRotationSpeed()` identifier - only *behavior* bugs are
// preserved, not misspelled identifiers): the speed-cap guard reads
// `abs(rot_speed <SPEED_CAP)` - parentheses around the wrong
// sub-expression. `abs()` ends up applied to the 0/1 *result* of
// `rot_speed < SPEED_CAP`, not to `rot_speed` itself - and `abs()` of a
// 0/1 value is a no-op (abs(0)==0, abs(1)==1), so this is mathematically
// identical to plain `rot_speed < SPEED_CAP` with no absolute value ever
// taken. The probably-intended check was `fabs(rot_speed) < SPEED_CAP`
// (an actual speed-*magnitude* cap); as written, a very negative
// `rot_speed` is NOT capped by this test at all. Preserved exactly below
// (written as the plain comparison it actually reduces to, since the
// `abs()` wrapper changes nothing) - not "fixed" to the probably-intended
// magnitude check. A few lines later, a *different*, genuinely correct
// `abs(rot_speed)` call (choosing the new speed's magnitude before
// re-applying a random sign) is ported as real `fabs(rot_speed)` (a
// proper float absolute value, unlike the buggy comparison above) since
// that one was never wrong to begin with.
//
// A third real, preserved bug, in `updatePump()`: `pump_delay == 0;` (a
// comparison, not the clearly-intended assignment `pump_delay = 0;`) is
// a no-op statement - real, observable consequence: `pumpDelay` is never
// actually reset after the pump's first "pulse" fires, so
// `pumpDelay > PUMP_DELAY` latches true forever from that point on; every
// later time `hexPump` decays back down to exactly 1, it immediately
// re-pulses to `HEX_MAX_PUMP` with none of the initial ~16-frame pause
// repeating. Preserved literally as a bare comparison-statement below.
//
// A fourth, harmless dead-code observation (not a bug, just documented):
// `mainGame()`'s own `if (GameState != GAMEOVER) { ... }` guard is
// provably always true whenever `mainGame()` itself actually runs, since
// the top-level `gmStates[]` dispatcher only ever calls `mainGame()`
// while `GameState == GAME` in the first place (a mid-tick transition to
// GAMEOVER, via `updatePlayer()`'s own `initGameOver()` call partway
// through this same block, doesn't retroactively skip the rest of the
// block that tick either). Preserved as a literal `if` below anyway (it
// costs nothing and matches upstream line-for-line), just noted here so
// it doesn't look like an oversight.
//
// SPRINTF: this dialect has no variadics, so `sprintf(b,"%03d",...)`
// (used upstream for every "TIME"/"BEST"/highscore 3-digit readout) has
// no equivalent. Replaced with a small local `hexFormatScore()` helper
// that computes the hundreds/tens/units digits directly into a
// 0-terminated `int[4]` buffer `gbPrintString()` can print - including
// porting the real optional "blank the leading zero digit(s) with a
// space" cosmetic upstream applies on the HUD (`drawHud()`) and menu
// (`drawMenu()`) 3-digit readouts. A genuine, preserved upstream
// *inconsistency* found while porting this: the exact same
// leading-zero-blanking snippet is present in `drawGameOver()`'s own
// TIME/BEST readouts too, but wrapped in a `/* ... */` block comment
// there - i.e. genuinely dead/disabled on real hardware, unlike the HUD/
// menu copies. So the game-over screen's own TIME/BEST always show a
// full zero-padded "007"-style reading while the HUD and menu blank
// leading zeros to "  7" - preserved exactly as this real inconsistency,
// not normalized to match either one.
//
// ICON GLYPHS: upstream's own `print(F("\25PLAY"))`/`F("\27QUIT")`/
// `F("\26Restart"))`/`F("\27Menu")` embed real Gamebuino font5x7 octal-
// escape icon glyphs (`\25`/`\26`/`\27` = decimal 21/22/23, low-ASCII
// custom icon glyphs real hardware's own font ships in place of the
// usual unprintable control-character range - see gamebuinoShim.c's own
// Font tables comment). Ported as small explicit 0-terminated `int[]`
// arrays with the icon code spelled out as a plain decimal literal
// followed by the rest of the text's own plain ASCII codes
// (`hexPlayText`/`hexQuitText`/`hexRestartText`/`hexMenuText` below) -
// the exact same "a bare quoted string literal can't hold a
// non-printable low-ASCII code" workaround already established by
// gamePunkt.c/gameUfoRace.c/gameSnakeAbc.c for this identical situation.
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED: all 3 of upstream's real
// `const byte NAME[] PROGMEM = {width,height,...}` bitmaps (`microHex`,
// the menu-screen logo; `hscr`, a small highscore-icon glyph; `gmover`,
// the "GAME OVER"-style banner text bitmap) were copied byte-for-byte
// into plain `int[N] name = {width,height,byte0,...}` arrays below (this
// dialect's own `int[N] name` array-declaration order - see gameConduit.c/
// gameFlappyBirdo.c's own established precedent) - already exactly the
// row-major/MSB-first/`ceil(width/8)`-bytes-per-row format
// `gbDrawBitmap()` expects (independently re-verified here by recounting
// each array's own real element count against its own declared
// width/height before trusting it, the same discipline gameUfoRace.c's
// own header comment describes), so no bit-repacking was needed, only
// the already-valid `0x`-hex literal syntax carried over unchanged.
// `hexDrawMenu()`/`hexDrawGameOver()` draw `hexBitmapMicroHex`/
// `hexBitmapGmover` at upstream's own real (x,y) anchors. MASK CHECK (see
// this project's own established "check for a mask/fill-under-bitmap bug"
// discipline from gameFlappyBirdo.c/gameParachute.c): none of these 3
// bitmaps has a separate upstream `*Mask` array, and none needs one -
// each is a small, fully self-contained opaque icon/logo/banner drawn
// once on top of a screen area upstream itself first clears with a plain
// `setColor(WHITE); fillRect(...)` (ported as `gbSetColor(0)`/
// `gbFillRect(...)`) immediately beforehand, not drawn over live
// busy gameplay pixels needing a real silhouette mask underneath.
// Upstream's own real two-arg `setColor(BLACK,WHITE)` calls around these
// bitmap+text groups became `gbSetColorBg(1,0)` - real Display::
// drawBitmap() itself only ever reads the foreground half either way
// (see gamebuinoShim.h's own header comment on gbSetColorBg()), so this
// only actually affects the opaque-background text prints that follow
// each bitmap in the same upstream block, exactly matching real hardware.
//
// `drawHexagon()`'s own dimmer "connecting spoke" lines from the small
// pump hexagon out to the full-size one use real `GRAY` (`gbSetColor(GB_GRAY)`
// - the shim's own dithered checkerboard color).
//
// NOTES ON REAL-HARDWARE RENDERING QUIRKS, AND THE ONE REAL ARCHITECTURE
// GAP THIS PORT HIT (flagging per this port's own instructions, not
// silently working around and moving on):
// 1. upstream's own `drawWalls()` genuinely needs a filled-triangle
//    primitive (`DRAW_MODE` is hardcoded to `1`, the real filled-triangle
//    path - `DRAW_MODE 0`, an alternate wireframe-only path built from
//    plain `drawLine()` calls, is real upstream code but is dead/
//    unreachable as shipped, since the `#if (DRAW_MODE == 0)` branch never
//    compiles with `DRAW_MODE` fixed at `1` - not ported here either,
//    matching real observed behavior). Filled wall wedges are this game's
//    own core visual identity, so every wall is drawn with the real
//    `gbFillTriangle()` shim primitive (a direct port of real
//    `Display::fillTriangle()`'s own scanline algorithm).
// 2. upstream's own `drawGameOver()` calls `gb.display.fillScreen(INVERT);`
//    for a brief flashing effect right when the round ends (the first
//    6-ish frames). Reading real `Display::fillScreen()` directly
//    (`utility/Display.cpp`) found a real hardware bug: its `color`
//    parameter is entirely unused - the function always fills solid black
//    regardless of what's passed, `INVERT` included. So upstream's own
//    "invert flash" never actually inverts anything on real hardware
//    either - it just flashes solid black for those frames.
//    `gbFillScreen()` matches this real bug exactly (its color argument is
//    ignored, always filling 0xFF), so this is ported as a plain
//    `gbFillScreen(1)` call at the same call site - correct, not a
//    downgrade, since that's what real hardware genuinely does here.
// 3. **No per-game "return to the cartridge's own top-level menu"
//    primitive is exposed to a game's own code at all** (only the
//    global Start-button quit-confirmation dialog, wired entirely inside
//    portVircon32.c, outside any individual game file, can do this - see
//    `currentGameIndex` in that file, never touched by any already-ported
//    game). Upstream's own internal-menu screen calls real
//    `gb.changeGame()` on a Button C press specifically to leave this
//    game for real hardware's own multi-program SD-card game-switcher.
//    This is an architecture gap, not a small missing primitive one
//    function could paper over (reaching into portVircon32.c's own
//    `currentGameIndex` from this file, which no other ported game does,
//    was considered and rejected as against this project's own
//    established grain) - so `hexMenuControls()` below simply doesn't
//    wire Button C to anything on the internal menu screen. The real
//    on-screen "QUIT" text prompt is left drawn exactly as upstream drew
//    it (real, unmodified screen layout) even though the button behind
//    it is now a no-op - leaving the cartridge for the shared menu is
//    still fully reachable the same way every other ported game reaches
//    it, via Start's own global quit-confirmation dialog.
//
// EEPROM: upstream keeps one real single-entry highscore table (`pos` is
// always called as `0` at every real call site - the multi-slot `pos`
// parameter is real, general upstream code, just never exercised beyond
// one slot in practice) at fixed byte offsets, gated by a real 2-byte
// `0x02FF` magic-number validity check. Ported directly:
// `EEPROM.read()/write()` -> `eeprom_read_byte()/eeprom_write_byte()`
// (this shim's own primitives already provide independent per-game
// address-space isolation plus their own magic/checksum corruption
// detection underneath - see eepromShim.c - so upstream's own real
// magic-number check here is redundant-but-harmless belt-and-suspenders,
// kept for fidelity rather than removed). Upstream's own declared-but-
// never-actually-called `readHSCName()` prototype (dead code - nothing
// upstream ever reads the stored name back) is not ported; nothing calls
// it on real hardware either.
//
// MATH: `sin`/`cos`/`floor` port unchanged (`math.h` is included once,
// globally, by main.c ahead of every game file - confirmed real
// functions per VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md, matching gameUfoRace.c's own
// established precedent for real trig). A local `HEX_PI` constant is
// used for the real `PI` this game needs (hexagon vertex rotation, angle
// wraparound) rather than math.h's own documented `pi` symbol - no other
// game ported into this project so far has actually exercised that exact
// symbol name, so this avoids betting on it sight-unseen; a plain literal
// float constant carries zero risk either way.
