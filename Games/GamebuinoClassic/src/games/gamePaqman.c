// Paqman (Yoda Zhang / "yodasvideoarcade", license: none specified -
// yodasvideoarcade.com/gamebuino.php). A real Pac-Man clone: guide Paqman
// around a scrolling 32x33-tile maze eating dots and 4 power pills while 4
// ghosts hunt him using a genuine real "Scatter"/"Chase" mode timer and
// per-ghost individual targeting AI (a home-corner ghost that follows
// Paqman directly, one that leads 4 tiles ahead of him, one that uses a
// doubled-vector chase off ghost 1's own position, and one that flips
// between chasing and fleeing to its own corner based on distance) -
// eating a power pill lets Paqman eat frightened ghosts for a doubling
// bonus, sending them home as "eyes" to respawn; a bonus fruit appears
// twice per level once enough dots are eaten. The last of this author's
// five "yoda-*" games sharing one file-split convention (killrace.ino/
// lander.ino/invaders.ino/asterocks.ino/paqman.ino, each split further
// into standard.ino/specific.ino/nonstandard.ino/images.ino/sounds.ino
// tabs) - the other four are already ported in this project as
// gameKillrace.c/gameLander.c/gameInvaders.c/gameAsterocks.c; this file
// follows gameAsterocks.c's own established translation pattern directly
// (same state-machine shape, same boolean-arithmetic helper, same sound-fx
// table shape, same blocking-titleScreen-as-pause approximation).
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why -
// this dialect has no classes/methods). `gb.display.cursorX =`/`cursorY =`
// ported unchanged (plain globals here too). `gb.display.print(...)` split
// into `gbPrintString()`/`gbPrintNumber()` (no overloading in this
// dialect). `random(N)` became `arand(N)` (this dialect's own established
// RNG helper); `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a
// documented no-op. `gb.battery.show = false;` was dropped outright,
// matching gamePong.c's own precedent (purely cosmetic on real hardware).
// Upstream's own `and`/`or` alternative operators became `&&`/`||`.
// Upstream's own `byte` fields (used throughout for lives/gamelevel/
// paqmanx/paqmany/most timers) became plain `int` - the same "every AVR
// fixed-width int type costs range/packing but nothing else once flattened
// to Vircon32's own single 32-bit int" reasoning already documented in
// gameAsterocks.c's own header comment applies unchanged. Upstream's own
// four globals `checkleft`/`checkright`/`checktop`/`checkbottom` are
// declared in paqman.ino but never referenced anywhere in any of the other
// five .ino tabs - genuinely vestigial, dropped outright (not ported as
// dead globals).
//
// Every global from this game uses a `paq`-prefixed name (checked against
// every other `src/games/*.c` file first - not already used; the game's
// own upstream `paqman*` variable names already started with "paq" so they
// keep their original spelling, just changed to a `paqmanX`-style
// dialect-appropriate case).
//
// ---- STATE MACHINE: upstream's own real `String gamestatus`, compared
// via `=="newgame"`/`=="running"`/etc (a real content-comparison operator
// overload C++'s String class provides, not available in this classless
// dialect) - replaced with a plain `int paqGameStatus` enum
// (PAQ_STATE_NEWGAME/NEWLEVEL/NEWLIFE/RUNNING/TITLE/GAMEOVER, plus one more
// added below), compared via `==` exactly like upstream's own String
// comparisons read. ----
//
// Upstream's own loop() body is a flat run of SEPARATE
// `if (gamestatus==X) { ... }` statements, in this exact order: newgame,
// newlevel, newlife, running, title, gameover - the exact same order and
// shape gameAsterocks.c's own loop() uses (same author, same convention).
// That file's own header comment already documents in detail exactly why
// this specific shape is load-bearing rather than a style choice (a real,
// deliberate same-tick CASCADE the very first time a game/level/life
// starts, since each `if` re-reads the just-updated variable within the
// same real gb.update() tick - see gameAsterocks.c for the full reasoning,
// which applies here identically since it's the same author's own loop()
// convention verbatim). Reproduced here the same way: five independent
// sequential `if`s in gamePaqman_update(), in upstream's own exact order,
// not an else-if chain.
//
// ---- The blocking gb.titleScreen() calls -> PAQ_STATE_SPLASH ----
// Upstream calls the real, blocking `gb.titleScreen(text, gamelogo)` at
// three real call sites, with the exact same two-caption inconsistency
// gameAsterocks.c's own header comment already documents for that game:
// once in setup() (caption "    Yoda's", WITH leading spaces), once from
// inside showtitle() when Button C is pressed (caption "Yoda's", no
// leading spaces), and once from inside checkbuttons() (called every tick
// during "running") when Button C is pressed mid-game (caption
// "    Yoda's", WITH leading spaces again) - preserved exactly via a
// `paqSplashShort` boolean flag rather than "fixed" to be consistent,
// following gameAsterocks.c's own identical precedent (`asterSplashShort`)
// for the identical upstream quirk. All three became one explicit
// PAQ_STATE_SPLASH state, dismissed by a genuine fresh `gbPressed(BTN_A)`
// (armed globally by `md_armInputAGate()`), always transitioning to
// PAQ_STATE_TITLE afterward - matching all three real call sites' own
// eventual real behavior. Real Display::titleScreen()'s own internal
// layout isn't available anywhere in this game's own .ino sources either,
// so this state's own screen reuses the exact same approximation
// gameAsterocks.c's own ASTER_STATE_SPLASH already established (the same
// logo-bitmap position, real caption text, added "PRESS A" hint line).
//
// ---- Mid-game Button C (pause-to-splash) approximation, reused from
// gameAsterocks.c's own identical precedent ----
// Upstream's own real Button-C-to-titleScreen check lives inside
// checkbuttons(), itself called partway through the "running" state's own
// per-tick sequence (6th of 18 calls: handleanimation, drawmaze, drawfruit,
// drawpaqman, drawready, checkbuttons, movepaqman, paqmanfulltile,
// determineshape, nextlevelcheck, drawdotspills, ghostmodetimer,
// settargettiles, handlepowerpilltimer, moveghosts, checkghostcollission,
// drawghosts, showscore) - meaning on real hardware the tick Button C is
// pressed, the first 5 calls already ran with the old game state, THEN the
// blocking call takes over, and only after it returns (gamestatus now
// "title") do the remaining 12 calls of that same tick run once more
// before the tick ends. This exact partial-tick nuance is inherent to a
// genuinely-blocking call and can't be preserved frame-for-frame in a
// non-blocking port regardless of where the check is placed (see
// gameAsterocks.c's own header comment, "Button C mid-game..." for the
// identical reasoning) - so this port reuses that exact same, already-
// proven "check first, return early" shape instead of inventing a new
// approximation: `gbPressed(BTN_C)` is checked at the very TOP of
// paqUpdateRunning() and returns immediately, skipping the rest of that
// tick's gameplay logic entirely. `paqCheckButtons()` below keeps only the
// four directional-input assignments (upstream's own real
// `gb.buttons.repeat(BTN_x,0)` idiom - ported as the literal
// `gbRepeat(BTN_x, 0)` upstream itself calls, matching this shim's own
// now-fixed `gbRepeat()` real "every held frame" semantics, not a worked-
// around substitute - see this project's own CLAUDE.md).
//
// ---- Boolean-arithmetic idiom -> paqB() helper, reused verbatim from
// gameAsterocks.c's own identical `asterB()` ----
// Upstream leans on the same "multiply a numeric formula by a boolean
// condition" idiom as this author's other games (e.g.
// `cursorX=40-2*(score>9)-2*(score>99)-2*(score>999);` in showscore()/
// showtitle()). Wrapped in a tiny local `paqB(bool)` helper (returns 1/0),
// the same dialect-safe stand-in gameAsterocks.c already established and
// proved compiles - not a fresh risk taken here.
//
// ---- Scratch globals folded into locals (behavior-preserving cleanup,
// not an upstream bug) ----
// Upstream's own `checkbyte`/`checkbit`/`checkval`/`checkvalue`/`paqpos`/
// `cpos`/`u1`/`u2` are all declared as top-level globals in paqman.ino, but
// every real use resets them before reading, function-call-locally, with
// nothing ever relying on a stale value surviving between calls (checked
// directly - no cross-function dependency exists on any of them). Declared
// as ordinary local variables inside paqPaqmanFullTile()/
// paqDrawDotsPills()/paqMoveGhosts() instead here, the same kind of
// cleanup gameAsterocks.c's own header comment documents doing for its own
// game's equivalent loose scratch globals.
//
// ---- `distance[4]`/float array avoided - a dialect-safety call, not a
// behavior change ----
// Upstream's own `moveghosts()` fills a real `float distance[4]` (one
// candidate direction's distance-to-goal per array slot) then scans it for
// the minimum. No other ported game in this codebase was found declaring a
// plain `float[N]` array (only `int[N]` arrays and arrays-of-struct
// containing float *fields* are proven so far - e.g. gameAgaruino.c's own
// `AgarBall[N]`) to confirm that exact declaration shape compiles here, so
// rather than risk it, this port restructures the same algorithm into a
// single running-minimum comparison (`float a`/`int b`, updated inside the
// same 4-iteration loop) instead of populating and re-scanning a stored
// array - mechanically equivalent to upstream's own
// `if (distance[u] <= a) { a = distance[u]; b = u; }` scan, just without
// ever materializing the intermediate array. `sqrt()` itself ports
// unchanged (already proven elsewhere in this project - e.g.
// gameKillrace.c/gameLander.c - `math.h` is included once, globally, by
// main.c ahead of every game file).
//
// ---- A theoretical (never observed) out-of-bounds read, preserved
// exactly as upstream wrote it - not exercised in real play ----
// Upstream's own direction-choice loop initializes `int a = 99; int b =
// -1;` then only ever assigns `b` when a candidate direction's own
// distance is `<= a`. If, hypothetically, all 4 candidate directions were
// simultaneously invalid (`checkvalue==1`, forcing `distance[u]=100`, which
// never satisfies `<=99`), `b` would stay `-1` and
// `ghostxdir[i]=checkxdir[b]`/`checkydir[b]` would read one element before
// each table - the exact same class of theoretical OOB read
// gameAsterocks.c's own header comment found and fixed for its own game's
// `ufo[-1]` case. This one is NOT fixed, and is preserved exactly as
// upstream wrote it, for a concrete reason that case didn't share: this
// game's real maze (`paqMazeScreen`) has no ghost-reachable dead ends, and
// the "no 180-degree reversal" rule is itself always waived in the one
// place a ghost could otherwise get stuck (the ghost-house doorway, `ghosty
// != 15 || (ghostx != 12 && ghostx != 15)`) - so at least one of the 4
// candidate directions is always legal at every real reachable tile,
// confirmed by reading `paqMazeScreen`'s own real wall layout directly, not
// just assumed. `b == -1` is therefore dead code on this specific maze, not
// a live, reachable bug the way the asterocks UFO case was - flagged here
// per this project's own "document uncertainty, preserve real bugs by
// default" policy rather than silently fixed or silently ignored.
//
// ---- Sound ----
// `playsoundfx(fxno, channel)` upstream builds a small per-channel
// FX-synth preset each call (waveform/instrument, volume slide, pitch/
// arpeggio slide `gb.sound.command(...)` calls, from the real
// `soundfx[8][8]` table) before playing one real note on top -
// `paqPlaySoundFx(fx, channel)` is a real, faithful port of this using
// this shim's own `gbSoundCommand()`/`gbPlayNoteChannel()` primitives (a
// direct port of real Sound.h's own per-channel tracker commands, the
// same established primitive gameAsterocks.c/gameKillrace.c/
// gameInvaders.c already use for this same author's other games).
// `paqSoundFx[8][8]` is a verbatim copy of upstream's own `soundfx[8][8]`
// table, and all 7 real `playsoundfx()` call sites now pass the same real
// channel number upstream itself uses at that exact site (0 or 1).
// Upstream's own direct (non-playsoundfx) calls - `gb.sound.playTick()` in
// handledeath(), `gb.sound.playOK()` on the title/game-over A/B presses -
// became `gbPlayTick()`/`gbPlayOK()` directly, unchanged.
//
// ---- Bitmaps - restored as real gbDrawBitmap() calls, not placeholders
// ----
// Every real PROGMEM bitmap byte in images.ino (plus the two large
// `dotscreen[]`/`mazescreen[]` bit-grid tables declared directly in
// paqman.ino itself) was mechanically converted from Arduino's
// `B00000000`-style binary literals to hex (`0x..`, this dialect has no
// binary-literal syntax) via a small local Python conversion script (not
// checked in - a one-off text transform, not a reusable asset generator
// the way tools/gen_column_atlas.py is) and cross-checked byte-count
// against each table's own declared width/height (208/15/1089 real bitmap
// bytes + 2-byte header each, for gamelogo/readylogo/mazeimage
// respectively; 5 bytes/frame x 20/12/8 frames for paqman/ghost/fruit;
// 132 bytes each for dotscreen/mazescreen) before being copied in verbatim
// as `paqGameLogoBitmap`/`paqReadyLogoBitmap`/`paqMazeBitmap`/
// `paqmanFrames`/`paqGhostFrames`/`paqFruitFrames`/`paqDotScreen`/
// `paqMazeScreen` below - every value in every table was verified to match
// the real source's own byte-for-byte binary pattern, not re-derived or
// approximated. `paqman[20][7]`/`ghost[12][7]`/`fruit[8][7]` keep their
// real upstream 2D-table shape (`int[20][7] paqmanFrames`, etc, indexed a
// whole row at a time straight into `gbDrawBitmap()`) rather than splitting
// into separately-named flat arrays - the same confirmed-safe pattern
// gameAsterocks.c's own header comment already established for its own
// `playership[20][9]`/`asterocks[12][22]`/`ufo[2][7]` tables.
//
// `dotscreen[]`/`mazescreen[]` are themselves already genuinely 1D real
// upstream byte arrays (each a 32x33-tile grid packed 8 tiles/byte,
// addressed by hand via `>>`/`%`/bitwise-AND throughout, not a real 2D C
// array at all) - so unlike the maze-grid case this project's own porting
// guidance specifically calls out for review, no flattening decision was
// actually needed here: upstream itself never declared a 2D array for
// either table, only ported verbatim as `int[132] paqDotScreen`/
// `int[132] paqMazeScreen`, indexed with the exact same real hand-rolled
// bit arithmetic upstream itself uses (`pos>>3` for the byte, `7-(pos%8)`
// for the bit, matching Gamebuino's own real MSB-first bitmap convention -
// deliberately NOT the same bit order as this shim's own LSB-first
// framebuffer, since these two tables were never rendered as bitmaps in
// the first place, only read as a pure collision/dot-state bitfield).
//
// No bitmap draw call site anywhere in this game's real source
// (drawpaqman/drawghosts/drawfruit/drawmaze/drawready, checked directly)
// is preceded by a separate mask/fill layer of the same shape - the
// mask-bleed bug class found twice in gameFlappyBirdo.c/once in
// gameParachute.c does not apply to this game at all, the same conclusion
// gameAsterocks.c's own header comment reached for its own game.
//
// EEPROM PERSISTENCE ADDED, BEYOND REAL UPSTREAM - no `EEPROM.read()`/
// `EEPROM.write()` calls exist anywhere in this game's real source, so
// `paqHighScore` was originally genuine in-session-only state. Added
// directly on request once an audit found this game displays a real
// highscore that never survives a cartridge reboot: `gamePaqman_init()`
// now loads it via `eeprom_read_word(0)`, with the same `==0xFFFF`
// fresh-EEPROM-cell reset check already established elsewhere in this
// project (see gameCrabator.c's/gameDescent.c's own identical check)
// rather than trusting a raw 65535 sentinel. Saved via
// `eeprom_write_word(0, paqHighScore)` at the exact point upstream's own
// real highscore-tracking line already updates it in memory - a one-shot
// write per new high score, not a per-frame write.
//
// ---- Shim gap check: none found ----
// Every real primitive this port needed already exists in the current
// gamebuinoShim.h/.c: gbBegin/gbSetFrameRate/gbUpdate/gbPickRandomSeed,
// gbPressed/gbRepeat (both already fixed per this project's own prior
// porting-batch bugfixes - used here via the literal upstream
// `gbRepeat(BTN_x, 0)` call), gbSetColor/gbCursorX/gbCursorY/
// gbPrintString/gbPrintNumber/gbDrawBitmap/gbFillRect/gbDrawRect/
// gbDrawFastHLine/gbDrawFastVLine/gbDrawPixel, gbPlayNote/gbPlayTick/
// gbPlayOK, and `arand()`/`sqrt()` from avrCompat.h/math.h. Nothing had to
// be worked around locally.
