// BlocksBuino (frthery, license: None specified -
// github.com/frthery/BlocksBuino - same author as this project's own
// gameSnakeAbc.c, see that file's own header comment for the same
// author's own recurring UI conventions, several of which reappear here
// verbatim). A Tetris-style falling-block game: the 7 standard tetromino
// shapes (line/cube/T/L/L-mirrored/S/S-mirrored) drop down a 10x16 well,
// move/rotate them with the D-pad/Button A, clear full rows for points,
// 9 selectable starting speed levels via an in-game level-select menu
// (Button C, mid-play, exactly like gameSnakeAbc.c's own GameMenu()).
// Source spread across 4 real upstream .ino tabs sharing one translation
// unit (blocksBuino.ino/rotation.ino/sounds.ino/sprites.ino) - all 4 read
// in full before porting.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a
// plain `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for
// why - this dialect has no classes/methods). Every global got a
// `blk`-prefixed name (checked against every other `src/games/*.c` file
// first, including the concurrently-ported batch - not already used).
// Upstream's own `boolean`/`short` all became plain `bool`/`int` (this
// dialect's own real primitives). `random(1, 8)` (Arduino's ranged
// random, exclusive of its upper bound) became `arand(7) + 1` (this
// dialect's own established RNG helper). `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became
// `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a documented no-op; `gb.battery.show = false;`
// was dropped outright - both match every other port's own identical
// treatment.
//
// ---- Array declarations (TYPE[N] name, not TYPE name[N]) ----
// Upstream's own `boolean blocks_activation[BLOCKS_MAX_Y][BLOCKS_MAX_X]`
// (the well/board grid) and `boolean lines_completions[BLOCKS_MAX_Y]`
// became `int[16][10] blkBlocksActivation` / `int[16] blkLinesCompletions`
// (0/1 flags) rather than `bool[][]`/`bool[]` - genuine 2D *int* arrays
// are already proven to work fine in this dialect (see gameConduit.c's
// own `int[6][8] condMap`/gameAsterocks.c's own `int[20][9]
// asterShipFrames`), but no `bool[N]` or `bool[N][M]` array has been
// proven anywhere in this project yet, so `int` (with explicit `0`/`1`
// assignments, never a bare `true`/`false` stored into either array) was
// used defensively instead of gambling on an unproven combination. The 4
// falling-piece cell arrays (`player_blocks1..4[2]`, rotation-point
// row/col pairs) became `int[2] blkPlayerBlocks1..4`, matching
// gameSnakeAbc.c's own identical `int[100] sabcSnakeX`-style precedent.
//
// ---- switch -> if/else-if (no switch statements proven to work) ----
// Two real upstream `switch(player_blocks_type)`/`switch
// (player_blocks_current_type)` statements (the next-piece preview shape
// in DrawNextBlocks(), and the rotation-function dispatch in
// RotateBlocks()) were both converted to if/else-if chains, every case
// preserved. Upstream's own rotation dispatch switch has NO case at all
// for BLOCKS_CUBE (cubes never rotate) and no `default` - ported exactly
// the same way: `blkRotateBlocks()`'s if/else-if chain simply has no
// branch for BLK_CUBE either, so pressing A while a cube is falling is a
// silent no-op, matching real hardware exactly. The preview-shape switch
// DOES have a `default` (an exact literal duplicate of upstream's own
// BLOCKS_CUBE preview, but with each cell's column shifted by one versus
// the real CUBE case - a genuine upstream inconsistency, verified by
// diffing the two bodies directly) - ported as the trailing `else`
// clause verbatim, unreachable in practice since `player_blocks_type` is
// always 1-7 from `arand(7)+1`, kept only for 1:1 fidelity.
//
// ---- Bitmap - restored as a real gbDrawBitmap() call ----
// The real upstream 64x36 title `logo[]` (shown via `gb.titleScreen
// (logo)`) is restored via this project's own gbDrawBitmap() primitive as
// `blkTitleBitmap`. Upstream's own literal bytes use Arduino's
// `B00000000`-style binary notation, not valid syntax in this dialect -
// converted to hex via a small Python script (regexed every `B[01]{8}`
// token out of the real sprites.ino and re-emitted as `hex(int(bits,
// 2))`), matching gameSnakeAbc.c's own identical conversion method for
// its own title bitmap. Spot-checked by hand: the first data byte
// `B00111110` -> 62 decimal -> `0x3e` (script output's first data byte,
// confirmed correct), and the very last row's `B11111111,B11111111,
// B11100000` -> `0xff,0xff,0xe0` (script output's last 3 bytes, confirmed
// correct: 0b11100000 = 224 = 0xe0). No GRAY mask/fill layer precedes
// this bitmap anywhere in the real source (only one drawBitmap call
// exists in the whole game) - the mask-bleed bug class found in
// gameFlappyBirdo.c/gameParachute.c does not apply here.
//
// ---- The blocking gb.titleScreen(logo) -> BLK_STATE_TITLE ----
// Converted to an explicit state (BLK_STATE_TITLE), dismissed by a
// genuine fresh `gbPressed(BTN_A)`, matching gamePong.c's own worked
// "blocking loop -> explicit resumable state" pattern. Unlike
// gameSnakeAbc.c's own GameMenu(), there is no way back to the title
// screen once dismissed (upstream itself never re-shows it - Button C
// mid-play opens the level-select menu instead, not the title screen),
// so this state is only ever entered once, at boot.
//
// Upstream's own re-entrant `game_menu`/`game_over` flags (checked at the
// top of loop(), each dispatching to GameMenu()/GameOver()) became
// BLK_STATE_MENU/BLK_STATE_GAMEOVER, and its own lazy
// "`if (!initialize) InitGame();`" re-init check (run unconditionally at
// the very top of every loop() iteration) was collapsed into direct calls
// to `blkBeginPlay()` at each of its own 3 real trigger points (title
// dismiss, a confirmed level-menu change, and a Game Over restart) -
// matching gamePong.c's/gameSnakeAbc.c's own identical "lazy re-init flag
// -> direct call-site reset" treatment. This changes nothing observable:
// upstream's own `initialize = false;` always leaves that same tick's
// remaining code doing nothing else useful anyway (game_menu/game_over is
// also cleared in the same breath), so the very next tick's dispatch
// already lands on the freshly-reset state either way.
//
// Upstream's own third level-menu option (Button C = `gb.changeGame()`, a
// real-hardware "switch cartridge on the SD card" OS feature) has no
// equivalent in this single-cartridge menu model and was dropped outright
// - Button C does nothing while the level menu is open here, matching
// gameSnakeAbc.c's/gameConduit.c's own identical precedent for the same
// real call. The level menu's own two `gb.display.fillTriangle(...)`
// up/down arrow graphics are drawn with the real `gbFillTriangle()` shim
// primitive (a direct port of real `Display::fillTriangle()`'s own
// scanline algorithm), at their real upstream coordinates
// (`gbFillTriangle(30,10,25,15,35,15)`/`gbFillTriangle(30,28,25,23,35,23)`
// in `blkUpdateMenu()`). Its own
// title line ("-CHOOSE GAME LEVEL-", plain ASCII) ported unchanged, but
// its own accept/cancel hints (`"\x15:accept \x16:cancel"` in the level
// menu, `"\x16:accept"` on the Game Over screen - non-printable custom
// Gamebuino icon glyphs, not supported by this shim's font) were replaced
// with "A=YES B=NO" and "PRESS B" respectively, matching gameSnakeAbc.c's
// own identical replacement text for the very same two glyphs.
//
// ---- Timing: millis() -> per-tick accumulators ----
// Upstream gates both the gravity/drop step (`game_prevTime`/
// `game_delai`, a per-level ms table) and the line-clear flash animation
// (`game_animation_delai_prevTime`/`game_animation_delai`, a flat 1000ms)
// on real `millis()` reads rather than `gb.update()`'s own frame
// throttle. Ported using a plain per-tick millisecond accumulator
// (`blkDropTimer`/`blkAnimTimer`, both bumped by `BLK_MS_PER_TICK` = 50 -
// this shim's own fixed logic-tick duration at its unchanged 20fps
// default) instead of a genuine `millis()` readout, matching
// gameSnakeAbc.c's own header comment point 7 for the exact same kind of
// conversion (that file's own established, accepted project-wide
// approach for this class of upstream timing code, not a new pattern
// invented here). One real behavioral difference this necessarily
// introduces: real wall-clock time keeps advancing while the level menu
// is open (paused), so on real hardware the drop timer would likely read
// as wildly overdue the instant play resumes; this shim's own
// accumulator instead simply doesn't advance at all while paused (Play()
// itself doesn't run then) - the same already-accepted divergence
// category as gameSnakeAbc.c's own, not a new one. Upstream's own
// `gb.setFrameRate(game_frame_rate)` call in InitGame() is commented out
// in the real source (dead, never executed) anyway, and this shim's own
// unchanged 20fps default already equals the real hardware default (see
// this project's own CLAUDE.md "frame-rate default bug" writeup) - so no
// `gbSetFrameRate()` call was needed here at all.
//
// ---- GetScoreString() -> blkPrintPadded() ----
// Upstream's own zero-padded HUD score/lines counters
// (`GetScoreString()`) built a `sprintf("%03i"/"%05i", ...)` string into
// a fixed-size `char buf[sizeBuffer]`, then split each resulting digit
// character back out by hand into a rebuilt `String` - a very roundabout
// way to print a zero-padded number, with no String/sprintf equivalent
// in this dialect anyway. Replaced with `blkPrintPadded(value, digits)`,
// a plain digit-extraction loop (divide/mod by descending powers of 10)
// that draws the exact same zero-padded text via `gbPrintString()`. One
// deliberate, documented divergence: upstream's own `sizeBuffer`-byte
// buffer (3 bytes for the lines counter, 5 for score) is smaller than
// what `sprintf("%03i"/"%05i", ...)` would actually write once the real
// value exceeds that width (`%03i` is a *minimum* field width, not a
// cap) - i.e. real hardware has a genuine latent stack-buffer-overflow
// bug the moment lines-cleared reaches 1000 or score reaches 100000.
// `blkPrintPadded()` instead just displays the low 3/5 digits once a
// counter grows past its field width - a deliberately more benign
// divergence from a real memory-corruption-class bug (not from any
// bug that's actually visible/load-bearing during ordinary play), chosen
// over reproducing an out-of-bounds write in this shared, linker-less
// single Vircon32 binary (see gameSnakeAbc.c's own header comment for the
// identical "avoid a real OOB write even where upstream's own version was
// harmless in its own isolated memory" reasoning already established in
// this project).
//
// ---- A real latent out-of-bounds READ, fixed defensively ----
// Upstream's own `CheckBlocksRotationCollision(x, y)` checks `x` against
// both bounds (`>= BLOCKS_MAX_X`, `< 0`) but only checks `y`'s LOWER bound
// (`< 0`) - never an upper one - before indexing straight into
// `blocks_activation[y][x]`. A freshly spawned piece can have cells at
// rows 16-19 (see blkNewPlayerBlocks() below - the well itself is only
// 16 rows, 0-15), and rotating while any cell is still up there computes
// a `y` of 17-20, reading straight past the real 16-row array - a genuine
// latent out-of-bounds read on real hardware. `blkCheckBlocksRotationCollision()`
// below adds an explicit `yNewValue >= BLOCKS_MAX_Y` guard (returning
// false - never blocks the rotation) rather than reproducing this
// verbatim, matching gameSnakeAbc.c's own documented precedent of
// defensively avoiding a real OOB access even where upstream's own
// version of it was harmless on real AVR's own isolated per-sketch
// memory - an actual OOB read here could instead read a completely
// unrelated game's own global state in this shared, linker-less single
// binary. "False" is also the semantically correct answer regardless:
// there are never any locked blocks above the real playfield.
//
// ---- Real, preserved upstream quirks (kept deliberately, not "fixed") ----
// - **Rotating never delays gravity.** `MovePlayerBlocks()`'s own local
//   `action` flag (set by a successful left/right move or a successful
//   soft-drop, and used to gate/suppress that tick's gravity check) is
//   NEVER set by a rotation - `if (gb.buttons.pressed(BTN_A)) { RotateBlocks(); }`
//   has no `action = true;` of its own, unlike the three movement
//   branches above it. So spamming rotation, unlike spamming movement,
//   does nothing at all to hold off the next automatic drop. Preserved
//   exactly (`blkRotateBlocks()` is called with no assignment to `action`
//   either, in `blkMovePlayerBlocks()` below).
// - **T/S/S-mirrored pieces spawn with one cell already inside the well.**
//   Every other piece's 4 spawn cells all start at row >= `BLOCKS_MAX_Y`
//   (16, i.e. fully above/outside the visible 16-row well) - but
//   `NewPlayerBlocks()`'s own real T/S/S-mirrored cases each place their
//   4th cell at row `BLOCKS_MAX_Y - 1` (15), already inside the visible
//   well one row lower than the other 3 cells, which still start at
//   16+. Since `CheckBlocksCollision()`/`DrawPlayerBlocks()` both only
//   test/draw a cell once its own row is `< BLOCKS_MAX_Y`, this one lone
//   cell is genuinely visible AND collision-tested starting the instant
//   these 3 piece types spawn, one tick before the rest of the piece
//   catches up - confirmed directly by diffing all 7 real spawn cases
//   against each other, not assumed to be a typo, and preserved exactly
//   (`blkNewPlayerBlocks()` below uses the identical row values).
// - **FIXED, NOT PRESERVED: DrawField()'s own field-outline rectangles.**
//   Taken completely literally, real upstream's own negative-height
//   `drawRect(field_x,field_y,field_w,field_h)` call draws nothing at all
//   (a negative `h` makes `Display::drawFastVLine()`'s own loop condition
//   false immediately, and both horizontal edges land outside the visible
//   0-47 row range) - an earlier pass through this file took that at face
//   value and shipped it as a preserved dead call. That conclusion was
//   wrong: a real screenshot bundled in upstream's own repo
//   (`pictures/BlocksBuino.png`) and a live user report against a real
//   emulator both clearly show a full-height double-line border down EACH
//   SIDE of the field only, with no horizontal cap at top or bottom.
//   `blkDrawField()` now draws the 4 real vertical edges directly (not via
//   `gbDrawRect()`, which would also draw the 2 horizontal edges), reading
//   `field_y`/`field_h` as "anchored at the bottom edge, height extending
//   upward" (the real top of each vertical line is `field_y+field_h`, the
//   real length is `-field_h`) - a normalization real
//   `Display::drawFastVLine()` itself never performs, but the only
//   geometry that reproduces the real, observed border - while the 2
//   horizontal edges stay at their original, always-off-screen position
//   (matching the real "no horizontal cap" look). See `blkDrawField()`'s
//   own inline comment for the full reasoning, including a first attempt
//   that went through `gbDrawRect()` and drew an unwanted extra top line,
//   caught and corrected via direct live user report.
// - **A single-line clear always scores flat 1 point regardless of
//   level, but 2+ simultaneous lines scale with level.**
//   `UpdateGameScore()`'s own `(player_nb_lines_completions > 1) ? (...*
//   (game_level+1)) : 1` - preserved exactly in `blkUpdateGameScore()`
//   below (as an if/else, no ternary operator in this dialect).
// - **`game_force_level`** is a compile-time-`const short` debug toggle
//   hardcoded to 0 - its own `if (game_force_level > 0)` branch is
//   therefore genuine, provably dead code in the shipped game. Kept as a
//   real `#define BLK_FORCE_LEVEL 0` + its own always-false `if` for 1:1
//   structural fidelity rather than silently dropped, since it costs
//   nothing to keep.
// - **`ShowDebug()`** is defined upstream but never actually called from
//   anywhere in the real source (confirmed by reading all 4 real .ino
//   files in full) - dropped entirely, matching gameSnakeAbc.c's own
//   precedent for dropping confirmed-dead upstream code.
//
// ---- Sound ----
// `PlaySoundFx(fxno, channel)` upstream builds a small "FX Synth" preset
// via several `gb.sound.command(...)` calls (waveform/volume-slide/
// pitch-slide, credited upstream to yodasvideoarcade.com - the exact same
// 8-column table shape already seen in gameSnakeAbc.c's/
// gameAsterocks.c's own `soundfx[][]` tables) before a final
// `gb.sound.playNote(pitch, duration, channel)`. This shim now has a real
// `gbSoundCommand()`/`gbPlayNoteChannel()` port of `Sound::command()`/
// `playNote()`, so `blkPlaySoundFx()` reproduces upstream's own
// `PlaySoundFx()` call-for-call (all 4 `.command()` calls plus the final
// `.playNote()`, verbatim-copied `blkSoundFx[4][8]` table, always channel
// 0 like every real upstream call site here).
//
// ---- gbFillTriangle() ----
// Used for two small decorative up/down arrows in the level-select menu
// (see `blkUpdateMenu()`).

    // a negative h, and both horizontal edges land at y=49/y=-1, off the

    // full-height double-line border down EACH SIDE of the field only - no

    // via gbDrawRect(), which would also draw the 2 horizontal edges): the
    // real y=49/y=-1 horizontal edges stay off-screen exactly as upstream's
    // own literal math already has them (matching the real "no horizontal
    // cap" look), while the 4 vertical edges are read as "anchored at the
    // bottom edge, height extending upward" - i.e. the actual top of each
    // vertical line is field_y+field_h (49-49=0) and the actual length is
    // -field_h (49) - a normalization real Display::drawFastVLine() itself
    // never performs, but clearly the intended shape (GetYcoordonnee()'s
    // own real formula already anchors block positions off field_y-1=48 as
    // the field's real bottom edge the same way). A first attempt at this
    // fix went through gbDrawRect() for both rects, which also drew an
    // unwanted horizontal line across the top (y=0) that neither the real
