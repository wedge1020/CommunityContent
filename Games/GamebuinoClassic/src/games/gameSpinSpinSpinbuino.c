// Spin Spin Spinbuino! (Charly Piva "Zoglu" / Margot Piva "Isil",
// zoglu.net - license none specified). A real-time dexterity/avoidance
// game: the player controls a spinning two-headed baton (constantly
// rotating on its own, direction reversible) that must be steered by the
// D-pad through 8 real hand-designed tile-mask levels toward a goal
// marker without letting either tip of the baton touch a wall, while a
// stopwatch times the run against a real per-level target time. Real
// upstream source: 10 real .ino tabs (spin/menu/niveaux/level_design/
// Joueur/collisions/explosions/affichages/bitmaps/credits.ino, 1560 lines
// total), real #include <Gamebuino.h> + <EEPROM.h>. Recovered via direct
// download (zoglu.net/trucs/spin_full.zip, the wiki's own listed link,
// still live) - a real wiki-listed game that was staged early but fell
// through the cracks of this project's own tier-triage process until a
// direct "status report on missing games" audit found it (see
// `more games/DISCOVERED_GAMES.md`'s own "Two more real staged
// directories..." section).
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a
// plain `gbY(...)` function call (this dialect has no classes/methods -
// see gamePong.c's own header comment for the full reasoning). Upstream's
// own single-instance `Joueur` struct was flattened into plain
// `spin`-prefixed globals (`spinX`/`spinY`/`spinXDiff`/`spinAngle`/etc)
// rather than ported as an actual struct - this project has no proven
// precedent for a struct with this many scalar fields, and flattening
// costs nothing for a genuinely single-instance object (the same
// treatment gamePunkt.c's own header comment already establishes for
// "many small objects" via parallel arrays - here there's only ever one
// object, so plain globals are the natural equivalent). Real `byte`/
// `char`/`unsigned int`/`boolean` fields all become plain `int` (this
// dialect has no narrower native types - see gameMaze.c's own header
// comment on why "just use int" costs nothing here); every real value in
// this game stays safely within 32-bit range throughout (level
// coordinates top out at 256, `x_full`/`y_full` at `x*5`/`y*5` <= 1280,
// nowhere near any width where AVR's native 16-bit `int` would have
// wrapped differently than this dialect's own always-32-bit `int` -
// checked directly, not assumed, per this project's own established
// narrow-int audit discipline).
//
// LEVEL DATA: upstream's own 8 real hand-designed levels (`niveau_0`..
// `niveau_7`, each a real 32-row x 8-byte, MSB-first tile-mask bitmap -
// one bit = one 4x4px solid block, decoded directly by `spinAfficheDecor()`
// below) plus their own real per-level settings arrays (start/goal
// position, spring count, spring positions/facings) were extracted
// byte-for-byte from `level_design.ino` via a small Python script (every
// `B01111111`-style Arduino binary literal converted straight to `0x7F`
// hex - this dialect has no such literal syntax - not hand-transcribed),
// stored as plain `int[256]` per-level data arrays and `int[]` settings
// arrays, verified against upstream's own real byte counts (every level
// body is exactly 256 bytes; every settings array's own real length,
// 5 to 35 bytes, matched exactly). Upstream's own real commented-out
// *earlier* draft level data (`level_design.ino`'s own large `/* ... */`
// block near the top of the file, an alternate `niveau_0`/`niveau_1` pair
// never actually compiled into any real shipped build) was correctly
// skipped, not accidentally included.
//
// `current_level`/`current_settings` (real `prog_uchar*` pointers,
// PROGMEM being a real no-op in this dialect per `avrCompat.h`) became
// plain `int*` globals (`spinCurrentLevel`/`spinCurrentSettings`),
// assigned directly from whichever `spinLevelNData`/`spinLevelNSettings`
// array `spinInitNiveau()` selects via a plain switch (upstream's own
// real `niveaux[]`/`niveaux_settings[]` array-of-pointers indirection was
// dropped - upstream's own `initNiveau()` already switches on the level
// number before ever touching that array, so the array-of-pointers layer
// was pure redundancy to begin with, not a real behavioral difference).
// `pgm_read_byte_near(current_level + idx)` became a small bounds-checked
// helper, `spinLevelByte()`, rather than a bare `spinCurrentLevel[idx]`
// read - a deliberate, defensive addition, not a real upstream behavior:
// `spinAfficheDecor()`'s own real scrolling-tile-lookup formula (ported
// unchanged from upstream) can compute an index past the real 256-byte
// level array's own end whenever the player is near a level's outer edge
// (upstream's own real comment-free code relies on real AVR flash simply
// returning whatever adjacent PROGMEM data happens to sit there, rendered
// harmlessly as "some other decorative block" and then immediately
// painted over by this same function's own explicit solid-black
// out-of-level-bounds border fill a few lines later - every real level's
// own solid outer wall ring keeps the player far enough from this in
// practice that it's cosmetically invisible on real hardware). This
// dialect's own arrays have no real adjacent-memory guarantee to lean on
// the same way, so `spinLevelByte()` simply returns 0 (an empty/background
// block) for any out-of-[0,255] index instead - functionally identical to
// upstream's own real on-screen result (still immediately overpainted by
// the same border fill either way), just without relying on undefined
// out-of-bounds memory contents to get there.
//
// BLOCKING `gb.titleScreen(F("Spin Spin Spinbuino!"))` -> EXPLICIT STATE:
// upstream's own real `initGame()` (which also reloads every real
// EEPROM-backed level-complete/highscore value and re-derives
// `unlocked_level`) is called both from `setup()` (real boot) and again
// from `updateMenu()` any time Button B or C is pressed on the level-
// select menu - a genuine "return to the title/logo screen" gesture, not
// a hard reset (menu position/highscores are all reloaded from the same
// real EEPROM values that were just saved). Ported as one shared
// `SPIN_MODE_TITLE` state (the "blocking widget -> explicit resumable
// state" treatment used throughout this project, see gamePong.c's own
// header comment) - `spinUpdateTitle()` draws the real title text plus a
// "PRESS A" prompt (matching every other ported game's own titleScreen()
// restoration; real `Gamebuino::titleScreen(title)` draws quite a bit
// more - the real boot logo, A/B/C button-icon hints - none of which
// exists in this shim, the same already-established simplification every
// other title-screen port here uses) and re-runs the same real EEPROM-
// reload/`spinInitMenu()` sequence on a fresh A-press.
// `gb.battery.show = false;` was dropped outright (no battery indicator
// exists in this shim at all - purely cosmetic on real hardware, matching
// every other port's own precedent).
//
// FRAME COUNTER: `afficheArrivee()`'s own real `gb.frameCount % 4` goal-
// marker animation cycle uses this shim's own `gbFrameCount` global
// directly (incremented once per real logic tick inside `gbUpdate()`,
// matching real hardware's own placement) - no local counter needed.
//
// REAL EEPROM PERSISTENCE - genuinely ported, not invented: upstream
// really does call `EEPROM.read()`/`EEPROM.write()` for each of the 8
// real per-level "complete" flags (address `i`, one byte) and 8 real
// per-level highscore timer values (address `32+i*2`, a real two-byte
// LSB/MSB-composed word) - ported via this project's own
// `eeprom_read_byte()`/`eeprom_write_byte()`/`eeprom_read_word()`/
// `eeprom_write_word()` at the exact same real addresses, rather than
// upstream's own manual LSB/MSB composition (this shim's own
// `eeprom_read_word()`/`eeprom_write_word()` already do exactly that
// composition internally - see gamePunkt.c's own header comment on this
// same shim primitive). Upstream's own real
// `if(highscores[i] > 2000) highscores[i] = 0;` fresh-value clamp
// (checked directly against this project's own established EEPROM
// int-narrowing audit - see CLAUDE.md's own "A project-wide EEPROM
// audit" section) already safely handles a genuinely fresh EEPROM cell
// here without any extra fix needed: a freshly-erased word composes to
// 65535 on both real hardware and this dialect alike (this dialect's
// `int` never narrows the way AVR's real 16-bit `int` would, but 65535
// stays well outside the same `> 2000` bound either way) - a real,
// already-safe "Category 1" case per that audit's own classification, not
// a new gap.
//
// REAL UPSTREAM QUIRKS PRESERVED, NOT "FIXED":
//
// 1. Real fallthrough in `drawExplosion()` (`explosions.ino`): `case 0`
//    has no `break` (falls into `case 4`'s own extra dots), and `case 1`
//    has no `break` either (falls into `case 3`'s own extra dots) - `case
//    2`/`case 3`/`case 4`/`case 5` all do `break` normally. A real,
//    deliberate-looking "denser explosion frame" effect (frames 0 and 1
//    draw more dots than frames 2/3/4/5 alone would), reproduced exactly
//    via the same real fallthrough in `spinDrawExplosion()` below, not
//    "corrected" into one dot-set per frame.
// 2. Real icon-glyph text strings (`"\25Next \26Retry \27Menu"` and
//    similar - octal escapes 025/026/027 = ASCII 21/22/23, real
//    Gamebuino font5x7 D-pad/button icon glyphs, not printable
//    characters) can't be held in a plain quoted string literal in this
//    dialect (confirmed unsupported outside ASCII 32-127, the same
//    finding gameTaquin.c's/gameSimonbuino.c's own header comments
//    already document) - ported as explicit 0-terminated `int[]` arrays
//    of literal decimal character codes instead (`spinFinPrompt`/
//    `spinRetryPrompt`/`spinPausePrompt`/`spinUnlockYes`/`spinUnlockNo`
//    below), the same treatment those two files already established.
//
// SOUND - GENUINELY RESTORED, not approximated: upstream's own single
// non-one-shot sound call, `gb.sound.playPattern(destroy, 0)` on a wall
// hit, is ported directly via the shim's own real tracker-engine
// `gbPlayPattern()` primitive against `spinDestroyPattern` (the real,
// verbatim `destroy[]` PROGMEM word array from spin.ino - 4 note/command
// words plus the real 0x0000 pattern terminator, matching upstream's own
// declared 5-word length exactly). No `gbChangePatternSet()`/
// `gbChangeInstrumentSet()` call is needed on channel 0 for this: the
// pattern array is played directly rather than looked up by ID, and an
// untouched channel already carries the real default square/noise
// instrument pair. `gb.sound.playOK()`/`playCancel()`/`playTick()`
// (Joueur.ino/menu.ino/credits.ino) are already real one-shot primitives
// with a direct `gbPlayOK()`/`gbPlayCancel()`/`gbPlayTick()` equivalent,
// so those call sites needed no change.
//
// gb.pickRandomSeed()/random() are never called anywhere in this real
// game (it's entirely deterministic - hand-designed levels, no
// procedural content) - no `arand()` usage needed anywhere in this port.
