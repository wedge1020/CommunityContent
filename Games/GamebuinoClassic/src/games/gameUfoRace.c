// UFO-Race (Rodot, license: none specified - github.com/Rodot/UFO-Race). A
// top-down racing game: pilot a flying-saucer-shaped "car" (drawn as a
// simple circle with a heading line, not an actual sprite - see
// ufoDrawPlayer() below) around a 32x32-tile track full of road/sand/ice
// surfaces, one-way "power" arrow tiles, bouncy/solid obstacle blocks and a
// single start/finish tile, trying to complete a lap in the fewest possible
// engine ticks. A small on-screen minimap in the corner always shows the
// local neighborhood of open track around the player. Real per-lap times
// are kept in a 5-entry highscore table, genuinely persisted to Vircon32's
// memory card via this shim's own eepromShim.h/.c - see "EEPROM" below for
// why this is a notable first for this project, not just another game.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why -
// this dialect has no classes/methods). `random(N)`/`random(a,b)` became
// `arand(N)`/`a+arand(b-a)` (this dialect's own established RNG helper).
// `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a documented no-op.
// Upstream's own `byte` fields/locals all became plain `int` (no `byte`
// alias exists anywhere in this project - unlike gameAgaruino.c's own
// `byte`-as-boolean case, nothing here is genuinely boolean, so `int` is
// the right substitute throughout, not `bool`). Upstream's own two
// `switch` statements (the friction/accelerator tile lookups in
// `updatePlayer()`) became if/else-if chains - this dialect's exact
// `switch` support is unproven, matching the same caution gamePong.c/
// gameAgaruino.c/gameTaquin.c already took. `cos()`/`sin()` port unchanged:
// `math.h` (already included once, globally, by main.c ahead of every
// game file) provides real `sin`/`cos`, so upstream's own float trig
// physics needed zero rewriting beyond adding explicit `(int)` casts at
// float-to-int call/assignment boundaries this dialect requires but real
// C++ did implicitly (e.g. `getTile(player.x/16, player.y/16)`'s own
// implicit narrowing to a `byte` parameter).
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED: every one of upstream's 16 real 16x16 tile
// sprites (`road`, `power_right/down/left/up`, `sand`, `ice`, `start`,
// `block_bouncer`, `block_single`, `block_right/down/left/up/horizontal/
// vertical`) plus the 64x36 title-screen `logo` were extracted byte-for-
// byte from the real `const byte NAME[] PROGMEM = {...}` arrays in
// upstream's own world.ino/titleScreen.ino via a small script that parsed
// the real .ino source directly and counted each array's own real element
// count in Python (34 ints per 16x16 tile = 2 header + 32 body bytes, 290
// for the 64x36 logo = 2 header + 288 body bytes) rather than
// hand-transcribing or guessing - into plain `int[N] name = { width,
// height, byte0, byte1, ... }` arrays below, the exact format
// `gbDrawBitmap()` expects, no bit-repacking needed. Every real
// `gb.display.drawBitmap(...)` call site has a direct `gbDrawBitmap()`
// counterpart: `ufoDrawWorld()` draws each track tile directly (checked
// carefully for the "upstream draws a mask/fill first" bug class found
// twice in gameFlappyBirdo.c - it does NOT apply here: every one of these
// 16 tile sprites is a complete, self-contained opaque tile texture drawn
// directly onto a screen `gbUpdate()` has just freshly cleared, with
// nothing else underneath it to bleed through and no separate upstream
// mask array declared for any of them), and `ufoUpdateTitle()` draws the
// real `logo` bitmap at (0, 12) - the exact real anchor
// `Gamebuino::titleScreen()` itself draws a passed-in logo at, already
// confirmed directly against the real Gamebuino.cpp source during
// gameFlappyBirdo.c's own port (that fact is a property of the one shared
// real library function every `gb.titleScreen(logo)` call site uses, not
// something specific to that game, so reusing it here is a confirmed real
// value, not a guess). At 64x36 anchored at y=12 the logo's own bottom row
// lands exactly on LCDHEIGHT (48) with zero clipping.
//
// A GENUINE UPSTREAM QUIRK, VERIFIED BIT-BY-BIT, PRESERVED: `world[]`
// (the packed 32x32 tile grid, 2 tiles per byte) is declared with an
// explicit real size of `WORLD_W*WORLD_H/2` = 512 bytes, but upstream's own
// initializer literal only actually supplies 256 of them (16 rows) - real
// C (and this dialect) zero-fills the remaining declared elements of a
// partially-initialized global array, so real hardware's own rows 16-31 of
// the nominal 32-row world are silently *all* tile id 0 ("road"), never
// actually laid out by upstream at all. Decoding the real row-15 payload
// bit-by-bit (a Python script, not by eye) confirms this is harmless in
// practice: every nibble in that row is >=8 (a solid wall), so the
// designed track is already fully enclosed and the player can never
// actually reach the always-road rows 16-31 to notice they're blank -
// preserved exactly as upstream shipped it (`ufoWorld` below is written
// out to its full real 512-int length, real values then explicit 0s,
// rather than relying on this dialect's own partial-initializer semantics
// matching C's, to remove any doubt).
//
// A SECOND GENUINE UPSTREAM QUIRK, PRESERVED: `getTile()` (used by
// `updatePlayer()`'s own collision/friction/accelerator checks) has no
// bounds guard at all on its `x`/`y` inputs, unlike `drawMap()`'s own
// separately-guarded minimap version - reading past the real declared
// `world[]`/`ufoWorld` extent would be undefined on real AVR hardware
// (whatever's next in flash) and would read an unrelated global's value
// here (Vircon32 does not hardware-trap a plain out-of-bounds array read -
// see VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md section 17.3's list of what *does* hard-trap,
// which is division/modulo-by-zero, `sqrt` of a negative, and
// `atan2(0,0)`, not plain memory reads). Verified this is inert in
// practice rather than just assumed: the track's own solid wall ring (rows
// 0 and 15, and the left/right border columns, all nibble values >=8 per
// the same bit-decode above) keeps the player's own tile-quantized position
// within bounds at all times, so `ufoGetTile()` below is a direct,
// unguarded port with no defensive clamp added.
//
// A THIRD GENUINE UPSTREAM QUIRK, PRESERVED: `drawMap()`'s own minimap
// culling test reads `tile_x > WORLD_W` / `tile_y > WORLD_H` (should
// arguably be `>=`, since valid tile indices only run 0..31) - an
// off-by-one that lets `getTile(32, tile_y)` execute for the minimap's own
// rightmost/bottommost edge case, reading one tile into the next packed
// row (or, for the single combination `tile_x==32 && tile_y==31`, exactly
// one int past the end of `ufoWorld`). Ported verbatim (`> UFO_WORLD_W`/
// `> UFO_WORLD_H` below, not `>=`) rather than "fixed" - this is a cosmetic
// minimap-only edge case (at most one wrong-looking pixel in the corner of
// an 18x18 overlay), not a crash risk on this platform (see the previous
// paragraph), and preserving real upstream boundary bugs by default is
// this project's own established norm.
//
// A FOURTH GENUINE UPSTREAM QUIRK, PRESERVED (but functionally inert):
// `drawWorld()`'s own two nested loops swap `WORLD_W`/`WORLD_H` between the
// `y` bound (`min(WORLD_W, ...)`) and the `x` bound (`min(WORLD_H, ...)`) -
// backwards from what the variable names suggest. Ported exactly as
// `gbMin(UFO_WORLD_W, ...)`/`gbMin(UFO_WORLD_H, ...)` in the same swapped
// positions below. Harmless: `WORLD_W`/`WORLD_H` (and this port's own
// `UFO_WORLD_W`/`UFO_WORLD_H`) are both 32, so the swap has zero actual
// effect - noted here so it doesn't look like a fresh porting mistake.
// `max()`/`min()` (Arduino macros, unavailable here, and no ternary
// operator either) became `gbMax()`/`gbMin()` (this project's own
// established real-function stand-ins).
//
// STATE MACHINE: upstream's own real control flow is a nest of blocking
// calls - `setup()` shows a blocking `gb.titleScreen(logo)` once, then
// `loop()` repeatedly calls `drawMenu()`, itself a blocking
// `gb.menu(pauseMenu, 4)` (a real library-built-in list widget, not
// hand-drawn by this game's own source at all - see "THE PAUSE MENU'S OWN
// LAYOUT IS A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION" below) dispatching via `switch` to
// `play()` (itself a blocking `while(1)` loop, exited only by a Button C
// press), `drawHighScores()` (blocking until A/B/C), or a small blocking
// System Info loop (exited by C) - with `default` (any unhandled menu
// result, including the real "Main Menu" entry, which upstream's own
// `switch` never gives its own explicit `case`) returning to the title
// screen. All of this was flattened into one explicit `UfoState` enum
// (TITLE/MENU/PLAY/HIGHSCORES/NEWHIGHSCORE/SYSINFO) dispatched from
// `gameUfoRace_update()`, matching the "blocking loop -> explicit
// resumable state" treatment used throughout this project (see
// gamePong.c's own header comment) - Button A dismisses the title screen
// (matching real `titleScreen()`'s own real dismiss button, and this
// engine's own menu-select button), Button C returns from PLAY to MENU
// (matching upstream's own real `play()` exit) and from MENU to TITLE
// (matching upstream's own real menu-cancel-or-"Main Menu" `default` case),
// and from SYSINFO back to MENU (matching upstream's own real dismiss
// button there too).
//
// THE PAUSE MENU'S OWN LAYOUT IS A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION, NOT A PORT:
// `gb.menu(pauseMenu, PAUSEMENULENGTH)` is a real, generic, built-in list
// widget implemented *inside* the Gamebuino Classic library itself (like
// `gb.titleScreen()`) - its own real pixel-level rendering isn't present
// anywhere in this game's own source to port, only the four real item
// strings it's called with (`"Play"`, `"High scores"`, `"System Info"`,
// `"Main Menu"`) and their real order, both kept exactly as upstream wrote
// them in `ufoUpdateMenu()` below. The actual on-screen layout (a simple
// UP/DOWN-navigated vertical list with a ">" cursor, confirmed via A) is
// this port's own reasonable custom rendering of that real menu, the same
// treatment gameFlappyBirdo.c's own difficulty-select screen already
// established as this project's norm for a real-but-library-internal
// upstream UI element.
//
// EEPROM - A REAL FIRST FOR THIS PROJECT: unlike every game shipped here so
// far (this project's own CLAUDE.md had flagged the still-unported
// `shipwrek` as the expected first real EEPROM consumer), UFO-Race's own
// highscore.ino genuinely calls real `EEPROM.read()`/`EEPROM.write()` -
// making this game, not shipwrek, the actual first real functional
// consumer of eepromShim.h/.c's `eeprom_read_byte()`/`eeprom_write_byte()`
// in this project. `ufoInitHighscore()`/`ufoApplyNewHighscore()` below are
// direct ports of upstream's own `initHighscore()`/the EEPROM-writing tail
// of `saveHighscore()`, keeping the real per-entry 2-byte LSB/MSB packing
// (`eeprom_write_byte(i*2, score & 0xFF)`, `eeprom_write_byte(i*2+1,
// (score>>8) & 0xFF)`) and the real bubble-sort-on-insert - but at a
// different, simpler byte layout than upstream's own real 12-bytes-per-
// entry one (10 name bytes + 2 score bytes), since names aren't stored at
// all here (see "NAME ENTRY - DROPPED, DOCUMENTED" below): just 2 bytes
// per entry, 10 bytes total across 5 entries. This isn't meant to be
// byte-compatible with a real cartridge's own EEPROM dump (a different
// game entirely on Vircon32's side, with its own independent memory-card
// slot anyway - see eepromShim.h's own header comment) - only upstream's
// real *behavior* (persisted, sorted, lowest-time-wins lap times) needs to
// survive a reboot, not a bit-for-bit-identical layout.
//
// A GENUINE UPSTREAM DEAD-CODE CHECK, PRESERVED AS-IS: `initHighscore()`'s
// own `highscore[i] = (highscore[i]==0) ? 9999 : highscore[i];` only ever
// matches a truly-zero stored value - but this shim's own EEPROM (matching
// the real ATmega328's own documented factory-erased state, per this
// project's own CLAUDE.md EEPROM section) reads fresh/unwritten cells as
// 0xFF, not 0x00, so a fresh table here decodes to 65535 per entry (LSB
// 255 + MSB 255<<8), never 0 - this `==0` check can never actually fire
// with this shim's own realistic defaults. Ported verbatim below (as a
// harmless, documented no-op) rather than silently dropped or "fixed"
// into a real sentinel check, matching this project's own established
// norm of preserving inert upstream logic rather than second-guessing it.
//
// The functional (not bit-for-bit) outcome matches real hardware too, by
// a different route worth spelling out precisely (see gameSkibuino.c's
// own header comment for a game where this same class of composition
// genuinely does NOT match real hardware, and had to be fixed): real
// `int highscore[NUM_HIGHSCORE]` is a genuine 16-bit signed AVR type, so
// the same fresh-EEPROM composition narrows to **-1** there, not 65535,
// at the point that intermediate `unsigned int` arithmetic gets assigned
// back into the signed `highscore[]` element. But real `saveHighscore()`
// takes its own `score` parameter as `unsigned int`, and comparing
// `unsigned int` against a signed `int` in C promotes the signed side to
// unsigned first - so real `score < highscore[NUM_HIGHSCORE-1]` actually
// evaluates as `score < 65535` on real hardware too (the stored -1
// reinterpreted back to unsigned for the comparison), identical to this
// dialect's own un-truncated +65535. Net effect: an entry no one has
// beaten yet DISPLAYS as -1 on real hardware vs 65535 here (a real,
// cosmetic-only difference in `gb.display.print()`'s own signed-vs-
// unsigned formatting - this shim's own `gbPrintNumber()` has no separate
// signed/unsigned overload to diverge in the first place), but the actual
// "is this a new highscore" decision every real cartridge and this port
// both make is the same, not a porting regression.
//
// FIXED FOR DISPLAY, NOT FOR COMPARISON: `ufoHighscore[i]` itself is
// deliberately left storing +65535 for a fresh entry (not real hardware's
// own -1) - this dialect has no unsigned type at all to launder a stored
// -1 back to 65535 the way real hardware's own mixed signed/unsigned
// comparison does, so storing -1 here would make `ufoApplyNewHighscore()`'s
// own `<` check permanently fail instead (the same real regression found
// and fixed in gameSkibuino.c). `ufoPrintHighscoreValue()` below instead
// special-cases only the on-screen print of that one exact sentinel value
// (65535 -> printed as -1), leaving the stored value and every comparison
// against it untouched - real hardware's own on-screen appearance is
// matched exactly with zero risk to the save logic.
//
// NAME ENTRY - DROPPED, DOCUMENTED: upstream's own `gb.getDefaultName(...)`
// + `gb.keyboard(...)` (a real on-screen text-entry widget for naming a new
// highscore) has no equivalent anywhere in this shim (no keyboard/text-
// input primitive exists at all - confirmed against gamebuinoShim.h's full
// real API surface). Per-name storage was dropped entirely rather than
// faked with a fixed placeholder string: `ufoHighscore[]` is a plain
// times-only table (matching this project's own established precedent for
// a feature with no shim equivalent, e.g. gameFlappyBirdo.c's dropped FX
// synth waveform shaping) - `ufoUpdateHighscores()` below shows only the
// five real times, right-aligned exactly like upstream's own real
// `LCDWIDTH-4*fontWidth` formula, with nothing in the name column upstream
// used to occupy (no invented replacement text was added there, to avoid
// presenting invented content as if it were real upstream layout).
//
// SOUND: upstream's own `highscore_sound[]` (highscore.ino) is a real
// 17-word `PROGMEM` pattern played via `gb.sound.playPattern(highscore_
// sound, 0)` right when the new-highscore dialog opens - now plays for
// real via `gbPlayPattern()`, the real tracker/pattern engine
// gamebuinoShim.c/.h implements (see that file's own Sound section header
// comment), using the real, word-for-word `ufoHighscoreSound[]` data below
// on channel 0, exactly like upstream, through the real default square-
// wave instrument (no `changeInstrumentSet()`/`command(CMD_INSTRUMENT,...)`
// call precedes it upstream either, so the engine's own real per-channel
// default is already correct). Every other real sound call ports 1:1:
// `playOK()`/`playCancel()`/`playTick()` -> `gbPlayOK()`/`gbPlayCancel()`/
// `gbPlayTick()`.
//
// `gb.popup(F("NEW LAP!"), 20)` (a real non-blocking overlay upstream
// shows for 20 real ticks while gameplay keeps running underneath it,
// distinct from every *other* blocking dialog in this game) is ported
// directly as `gbPopup("NEW LAP!", 20)`, which auto-draws itself on top of
// everything else already drawn that frame.
//
// SYSTEM INFO - HONEST PLACEHOLDER, NOT FABRICATED DATA: upstream's own
// System Info screen reads real hardware telemetry this shim has no
// equivalent for at all (`gb.battery.voltage/level`, `gb.backlight.
// ambientLight/backlightValue`, `gb.sound.getVolume()`/`volumeMax` - none
// of these exist anywhere in gamebuinoShim.h). Rather than inventing
// plausible-looking fake numbers for them, `ufoUpdateSysInfo()` below
// keeps the real menu entry (matching upstream's own real item) but shows
// a short, honest "no sensors emulated here" message instead - the same
// spirit as this project's own established norm of dropping a feature
// outright rather than faking data for it (e.g. GRAY, the FX synth), just
// applied to a whole screen instead of one visual element.
//
// `gb.battery.show = false;` (real setup()-time cosmetic battery-icon
// suppression) was dropped outright, matching gamePong.c's own identical
// treatment of the same real-hardware-only feature.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Real upstream tile sprites (16x16) and title logo (64x36) - byte-for-byte
