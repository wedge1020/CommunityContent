// Castle Defence (kh9282, no license specified -
// github.com/kh9282/CastleDefence). A top-down tower-defense-flavored
// shooter: monsters climb five fixed lanes toward a castle at the top of
// the screen; the player walks a horizontal strip near the bottom and
// shoots them with one of three weapons (rifle/shotgun/sniper, chosen as
// a main+sub pair at the start of a run) before they reach the castle
// wall. Every 15 kills levels up (raising monster HP/speed and, every 5th
// level, spawning a boss "king" that must be killed to unlock a shop
// where coins earned from kills buy permanent damage/ammo/ability
// upgrades). Source is 5 real upstream `.ino` tabs sharing one real
// Arduino translation unit (Castle.ino/attack.ino/image.ino/monster.ino/
// shop.ino, confirmed no other `.ino` files exist in the staged
// directory) - all read in full before porting.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a
// plain `gbY(...)` function call (this dialect has no classes/methods -
// see gamePong.c's own header comment for the full reasoning). Upstream's
// own `byte`/`boolean` types became plain `int`/`bool` (this project's own
// established avrCompat.h convention - see that file's own header comment
// on why aliasing every AVR fixed-width type costs only range, not
// correctness, for the vast majority of code). Upstream's own C++ structs
// (`Gun`, `Monster`) ported directly as real Vircon32 structs
// (`CdefGun[3] cdefGuns`, `CdefMonster[5] cdefMon`) - struct arrays are
// proven to compile in this dialect (gameFlappyBirdo.c's own `FlapPipe[3]
// flapPipes`, gameAgaruino.c's own `AgarBall` struct, etc.), and every
// array declaration everywhere in this file uses this dialect's own
// required `TYPE[N] name` order, never `TYPE name[N]`. No `switch`
// statement is used anywhere (every real upstream `switch(weapon)`/
// `switch(Me_HP)`/`switch(mon_num)`/etc became an if/else-if chain,
// matching this project's own "no switch statement proven to work"
// convention). Every real Arduino `B00000000`-style binary literal (only
// present in `image.ino`'s own `Rifle[]`/`Shotgun[]`/`SniperRifle[]`/
// `rifle_img[]`/`shotgun_img[]`/`sniper_img[]`/`motion_slow[]` bitmaps -
// every other bitmap table upstream already used plain `0x` hex) was
// converted to `0x` hex by a small one-off local script, byte-count
// verified against each bitmap's own real `{width,height,...}` header
// before being pasted in below - every other real PROGMEM bitmap byte
// here is copied verbatim, unchanged. Every real `random(N)`/
// `random(min,max)` call became `arand(N)`/`min + arand(max-min)` (this
// project's own established RNG-conversion formula), including upstream's
// own real range bugs this produces byte-for-byte (see "Preserved real
// upstream bugs" below). `gb.pickRandomSeed()` has no call site in this
// particular upstream source (it's never called) - not ported, nothing to
// no-op. Global naming prefix: `cdef` (verified unused by every other game
// shipped or concurrently in flight in this project).
//
// REAL 2D BITMAP TABLES (`fence[][18]`/`monster[][20]`/`king[][40]`/
// `king_skil[][40]`/`motion_stun[][38]`) ported as real Vircon32 2D
// `int[N][M]` tables (`cdefFenceBitmaps`/`cdefMonsterBitmaps`/
// `cdefKingBitmaps`/`cdefKingSkilBitmaps`/`cdefMotionStunBitmaps`),
// exactly like this project's own already-proven `gameLander.c`
// (`landSpaceship[6][8]`)/`gameAsterocks.c` (`asterShipFrames[20][9]`)
// precedent - `cdefKingBitmaps[i]` decays to the `int*` `gbDrawBitmap()`
// expects, exactly like those two files' own established call pattern.
// `motion_stun[][38]` upstream is genuinely a 3-entry table whose real
// LAST entry is `{}` (an empty C initializer, i.e. every one of its 38
// bytes real-C-zero-fills to 0) - real `stunmotion_time[]` cycling 0,1,2
// really does index into that empty entry one frame in three (see
// `Motion_stun()`'s own real `<=1` cycle test), so `cdefMotionStunBitmaps`
// keeps a real explicit all-zero third row (`{0,0,0,...}`, width=0/
// height=0) rather than silently dropping it - `gbDrawBitmap()` on a 0x0
// bitmap is a real, harmless no-op, reproducing upstream's own actual
// "blank flicker frame" every third stun-animation tick exactly.
//
// BLOCKING-LOOP -> STATE MACHINE, upstream's own real nested
// `while(weapon_select){if(gb.update()){...}}` / `while(!readyGo){...}` /
// blocking `GameOver()`/`display_highScore()`/`displaymessage()`-modal
// while(true) loops all became explicit states (`CDEF_STATE_TITLE`/
// `_WEAPON_SELECT`/`_READY`/`_PLAY`/`_SHOP_MESSAGE`/`_GAMEOVER`, plus
// `CDEF_STATE_HIGHSCORE` with a `cdefHighscoreReturn` field remembering
// which of the two real call sites - weapon-select's own UP-button peek,
// or the post-game-over flow - should resume once it's dismissed),
// matching the "blocking loop -> explicit resumable state" treatment
// this project uses throughout (see gamePong.c's own header comment).
// Upstream's real `gb.titleScreen(F("Castle Defence!"))` (called with no
// logo bitmap, at 3 real call sites: setup(), weapon-select's own
// Button-C "restart", and GameOver()'s own ending) is now one shared
// `cdefBeginTitle()`/`cdefUpdateTitle()` pair, dismissed by a genuine
// fresh `gbPressed(BTN_A)` exactly like every other titleScreen()
// conversion in this project - `cdefInitGame()` (the direct port of
// upstream's own real `initGame()`) runs on that same A-press, matching
// upstream's own real "titleScreen() blocks, THEN initGame() runs" call
// order at all 3 real sites. `load_Highscore()` itself only has one real
// call site (setup(), once ever) and is ported the same way, called once
// from `gameCastleDefence_init()`, not tied to every title re-visit.
//
// A REAL CONTROL-FLOW-ABANDONMENT QUIRK, preserved on purpose: upstream's
// own `GameOver()` and `displaymessage()`'s own buy-modal are both
// genuinely blocking calls made from partway through the main per-tick
// draw sequence (`displayHP()`'s own `case 0: GameOver();` and
// `display_Shop()`'s own per-item `displaymessage()` call) - meaning
// real hardware never executes the REST of that tick's own remaining
// upstream code (shot-bar/ammo/level-up/monster-drop/the other 8 shop
// item boxes/boss-kill-check/player-draw/movement/attack/reload/weapon-
// change) once either blocking path is entered, for that tick or any
// future tick until the blocking call itself returns. Reproduced exactly
// here: `cdefUpdatePlay()` explicitly checks `cdefState` immediately
// after calling `cdefDisplayHp()` and after calling `cdefDisplayShop()`
// and returns early the instant either one has switched state to
// `CDEF_STATE_GAMEOVER`/`CDEF_STATE_SHOP_MESSAGE`, so the remainder of
// that tick's own draw/input code is genuinely skipped, matching real
// hardware's own abandoned call stack rather than "helpfully" letting
// the rest of the tick run anyway.
//
// PRESERVED REAL UPSTREAM BUGS (kept exactly as shipped, not fixed - this
// project's own default per CLAUDE.md, matching the precedent already set
// by e.g. gameAgaruino.c's own preserved backwards on-screen-culling
// test):
//
// 1) FIXED, NOT PRESERVED - was: `displayHP()`'s own real `switch(Me_HP)
//    {case 7:...case 0:GameOver();}` had NO case for `Me_HP==1` (drawn HP
//    bar segment silently vanished for exactly 1 HP) and, critically, NO
//    default/fallback for any negative value either - and a boss hit
//    subtracts 2 in one step (`Me_HP -= 2`), so a player at exactly 1 HP
//    hit by the boss dropped straight to -1, skipping over the exact
//    `case 0` match GameOver() needed to ever trigger - a real potential
//    "HP goes permanently negative, game never ends" soft-lock. Fixed in
//    `cdefDisplayHp()`: a case for HP==1 now draws a final sliver, and the
//    game-over check is `<= 0` instead of `== 0`.
// 2) FIXED, NOT PRESERVED - was: `GameOver()`'s own real end-of-round slide
//    animation (`if(camera_y) camera_y++; else if(camera_y<=0){...show
//    GAME OVER text/scoring...}`) only ever reached its "else" branch (the
//    one that actually shows the GAME OVER text and reads Button B) once
//    `camera_y` counted UP to exactly 0 - which only happens if `camera_y`
//    was negative or already 0 at the moment of death. If the player had
//    been climbing (camera_y is incremented positive while moving up
//    beyond the starting view - a completely normal, easily reached play
//    pattern), `camera_y` at death was already positive, and incrementing
//    a positive number only moved it further from 0 - so the GAME OVER
//    text (and the only Button-B check that can exit this state) could
//    permanently never appear. Fixed in `cdefUpdateGameOver()`: camera_y
//    now moves toward 0 from either side.
// 3) FIXED, NOT PRESERVED - was: the real Level-up floor guard
//    `if(!mon_Ramdom_MAX <= 40) mon_Ramdom_MAX -= 10;` is a real operator-
//    precedence bug: `!` binds tighter than `<=`, so `!mon_Ramdom_MAX` (0
//    or 1) compared `<= 40` was ALWAYS true regardless of
//    `mon_Ramdom_MAX`'s actual value - the intended "stop decreasing once
//    low enough" floor never applied, and `mon_Ramdom_MAX -= 10` really
//    ran unconditionally every time `Level % 3 == 0`, shrinking monster
//    toughness variance unboundedly instead of leveling off. Fixed in the
//    level-up block in `cdefUpdatePlay()`: the decrement is now genuinely
//    gated on `cdefMonRandomMax > 40`.
// 4) FIXED, NOT PRESERVED - was: `shop.ino`'s own `displaymessage()`, for
//    `weapons==0` (rifle) only, checked `if(type==2){...life-recovery
//    text/purchase...}` as a SEPARATE, unconditional statement AFTER the
//    `if(owned){...} else {println(" Impossible!");}` block - not nested
//    inside an else-if chain the way the shotgun/sniper cases
//    (`weapons==1`/`2`) both are. Since the life-recovery item (row 3,
//    column 1 of the shop) is reachable regardless of whether the player
//    actually owns the rifle, a player who didn't pick the rifle saw BOTH
//    "Impossible!" (from the ownership check) AND the real life-recovery
//    text/purchase option stacked on the same screen. Fixed in
//    `cdefUpdateShopMessage()`'s display code: `type==2` is now checked
//    first and shown on its own, with "Impossible!" only shown for the two
//    real rifle upgrades when the rifle isn't owned - the buy-on-A-press
//    logic already correctly allowed life recovery regardless of
//    ownership and needed no change.
// 5) Every upstream `random(min,max)` real range quirk survives this
//    project's own established `min + arand(max-min)` conversion exactly
//    (matching real Arduino `random(min,max)`'s own `[min,max)`
//    half-open range) - e.g. `displayHP()`'s own critical-HP shake jitter
//    (`random(-1,+1)`) really only ever produces -1 or 0, never +1, on
//    real hardware too; ported as `-1 + arand(2)` (never `+1`), not
//    "fixed" into a symmetric ±1 jitter.
// 6) BYTE WRAPAROUND, NOT REPRODUCED (a whole-project simplification, not
//    specific to this game - noted once here rather than at every
//    individual occurrence): several real upstream fields this game
//    mutates with a signed delta were declared `byte` (real unsigned
//    8-bit AVR arithmetic, e.g. `shake_x`/`shake_y`, `mon_Ramdom_MAX`,
//    `Boss_message`) - on real hardware, e.g. `shake_x += (a negative
//    random value)` from a 0 baseline would wrap to a huge value near
//    255 instead of going negative. This project's own established
//    avrCompat.h convention aliases every AVR fixed-width type straight
//    to a full-range `int` project-wide (see that file's own header
//    comment) specifically because reproducing every individual byte-
//    wraparound site case-by-case was judged not worth the fragility -
//    so this specific wraparound quirk does not reproduce here, unlike
//    the bugs 1-5 above (which are all real *logic* bugs, not artifacts
//    of AVR's own integer width, and so are preserved).
//
// A REAL BUG THAT DOES **NOT** REPRODUCE HERE, BY DESIGN, NOT OVERSIGHT:
// upstream's own weapon-select screen calls the real blocking
// `display_highScore()` synchronously from inside its own per-tick body
// on an UP press, and - because real hardware's own nested `while(true)`
// loops share one continuous button-sample state within a single call
// stack - the SAME physical A/B/C press used to dismiss that highscore
// screen can still read as "just pressed" an instant later back in
// weapon-select's own remaining per-tick code path (never re-sampled by a
// fresh `gb.update()` in between) - the exact same class of bug this
// project's own `md_armInputAGate()` exists to prevent elsewhere (see
// this project's own CLAUDE.md). This port's own state-machine
// architecture (one state's update function runs per real engine tick,
// full stop - `CDEF_STATE_HIGHSCORE` returning to
// `CDEF_STATE_WEAPON_SELECT` takes effect on the FOLLOWING tick, which
// calls `gbUpdate()` fresh and re-samples buttons for real) structurally
// cannot reproduce this one, the same way gamePong.c's/gameMaze.c's own
// title/play transitions already don't - not something to fix, since it
// was never introduced in the first place.
//
// SHIM GAPS - ALREADY-DOCUMENTED, NOT NEW (established precedent exists
// in other ported games; not flagged as a fresh finding):
// - `gb.popup(text, 10)` (real transient overlay, used 3 times in
//   `displaymessage()`'s own buy logic for "Upgrade complete!"/"Have no
//   money."/"Your Life is full.") is provided directly by `gbPopup()` in
//   `gamebuinoShim.h`/`.c` (a direct port of real `Gamebuino::popup()`/
//   `updatePopup()`), which auto-draws itself on top of everything else
//   already drawn that frame, regardless of screen/state - all three call
//   sites call `gbPopup(text, 10)` directly (the same real upstream
//   duration).
// - `gb.getDefaultName()`/`gb.keyboard()` (real on-screen name entry for
//   a new high score) has no shim equivalent (see gameUfoRace.c's own
//   header comment) - per-name storage was dropped entirely rather than
//   faked with a placeholder string, matching that file's own established
//   precedent: `cdefHighscores[5]` is a plain scores-only table (no name
//   column at all, upstream's own `name[][]`/`NAME_LENGTH` not ported).
// - `gb.battery.show = false;` was dropped outright (purely cosmetic on
//   real hardware, no equivalent needed - matching every other port's own
//   treatment).
// - `gb.display.textWrap = false;` (set once, in `display_highScore()`)
//   was dropped as a genuine no-op rather than a gap: this shim's own
//   `gbPrintString()` never auto-wraps at the screen edge in the first
//   place (only an explicit `\n` moves to a new line - see
//   gamebuinoShim.c's own header comment), so upstream's own request to
//   disable wrapping is already exactly this shim's only real behavior.
// - Real low-ASCII icon glyphs upstream embeds inline via octal escapes
//   (`"please button\26"`, `"Reload \35"`, `"DANGER\01"`,
//   `"\25:Buy        \26:cancel"` - decimal 22/29/1/21+22) are restored
//   via direct `gbDrawChar(code, x, y)` calls at the right point in each
//   string (`cdefDrawIcon()` below) rather than embedded as raw control
//   bytes inside a string literal, matching this project's own
//   established gameHexagon.c/gameJezzball.c/gamePunkt.c precedent for
//   exactly this situation.
// No other shim gap was found - `gbDrawBitmap()`/`gbDrawChar()`/
// `gbRepeat()`/`gbCollidePointRect()`/real `gbFont5x7`/`gbFont3x5`/
// `eeprom_read_word()`/`eeprom_write_word()` all exist and are used
// directly as documented, with no local workaround needed for any of
// them.
//
// EEPROM: upstream genuinely calls real `EEPROM.read()`/`EEPROM.write()`
// in `save_Highscore()`/`load_Highscore()` for a real 5-entry high-score
// table, so this port genuinely uses this project's own eepromShim.h
// (`eeprom_read_word()`/`eeprom_write_word()`, 2 bytes per score, 5
// scores = addresses 0-9 of the shim's own 1024-byte-per-game slot) -
// not invented persistence upstream doesn't have. Upstream's own real
// fresh-EEPROM guard (`Highscores[i] == 0xFFFF ? 0 : Highscores[i]`,
// since real factory-erased AVR EEPROM - and this shim's own fresh
// cells, see eepromShim.h's own header comment - both read as 0xFF per
// byte) is preserved exactly in `cdefLoadHighscore()` below.
//
// CURSOR-CASCADE NOTE: this shim's own `gbUpdate()` resets
// `gbCursorX`/`gbCursorY` to (0,0) at the start of every real engine tick
// (a shim-specific convenience documented directly in gamebuinoShim.c,
// unlike real hardware's own persistent cursor) - so upstream's own
// several `println()` cascades that never explicitly set a starting
// cursor position (e.g. `displayHP()`'s own "Lv"/level/"$"/coin block)
// resolve to the exact same deterministic on-screen position every
// single tick here, rather than inheriting whatever an unrelated
// previous frame happened to leave the cursor at on real hardware - a
// cleaner, still fully upstream-literal (upstream's own source never
// specifies a position for that block either) reproduction. A small
// local `cdefPrintln()`/`cdefPrintlnNum()` pair (print, then advance
// `gbCursorY` by one real font line and reset `gbCursorX` to 0) stands in
// for upstream's own real `Print::println()` throughout, since this
// shim's own `gbPrintString()` only auto-advances on an explicit `\n`
// inside the string it's given, not automatically after every call.
//
// Dead/unused code NOT ported (confirmed genuinely inert, not a missed
// feature): upstream's own top-level `byte screen;` is declared and
// assigned `screen = 0;` in `initGame()` but never read anywhere in any
// of the 5 real `.ino` files - matching gameLander.c's own "confirmed
// dead" precedent, it's simply not ported here at all.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Real upstream bitmaps - copied byte-for-byte from image.ino's own real
// `const byte NAME[] PROGMEM = { width, height, ... }` arrays (every real
// PROGMEM byte becomes one plain int cell, matching every other bitmap
// table in this project). The handful that used real Arduino
// `B00000000`-style binary literals (Rifle/Shotgun/SniperRifle/
// rifle_img/shotgun_img/sniper_img/motion_slow) were converted to `0x`
// hex - byte-count-verified against each one's own real header before
// being pasted in, no bits altered.
