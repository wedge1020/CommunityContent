// GlaciGlaca (Clement83, License: None specified -
// github.com/Clement83/GlaciGlaca). An ice-cream-shop management sim: each
// of up to 7 real days ("jour"), the player first spends the previous day's
// takings ("cagnotte") restocking cone types ("pot"/"cornet"/"luxeCornet")
// and 12 real ice-cream flavors from a small in-game shop, then serves a
// randomly-sized queue of clients (queue size driven by a random "weather"
// roll shown as a sun/cloud/rain icon) - each client silently "orders" one
// cone + 2 scoops (drawn as icons in a speech bubble), the player picks a
// cone + 2 scoops to match, and gets paid (or docked a real per-item
// "malus") based on how many of the 3 choices were actually correct. Stock
// decays 20% overnight; running out of both cagnotte and stock ends the
// game early, as does reaching day 7.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why -
// this dialect has no classes/methods). Every global got a `glaci`-prefixed
// name (this cartridge has no linker - every ported game shares one C
// translation unit). `random(a,b)` became `a + arand(b-a)` (this dialect's
// own established RNG helper); `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became the documented
// no-op `gbPickRandomSeed()`, called at the same real upstream site
// (`initGame()`, ported as `glaciBeginDifficultyMenu()`) purely for
// fidelity. `gb.battery.show = false;` was dropped outright (purely
// cosmetic - same precedent as gamePong.c).
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED, verified byte-for-byte via a small Python
// script that re-parsed every real `const byte NAME[] PROGMEM = {...}`
// array directly out of the real `.ino` source (not hand-transcribed) and
// cross-checked each one's own real `width,height` header against its own
// real byte count (`ceil(width/8)*height + 2 == arrayLength`) before
// trusting it - all 72 real sprites needed by this port (12 flavor icons,
// 3 weather icons, 3 cone/cornet icons, 1 speech-bubble outline, 1 UI
// arrow, 1 title splash, and all 17 clients' own 3 real mood sprites -
// N(ormal, arriving)/C(ontent, happy departure)/PC(pas content, unhappy
// departure) - each) passed. Every one is a real, direct
// `int[N] glaciBmpXxx = { width, height, byte0, byte1, ... }` array, the
// exact format `gbDrawBitmap()` expects - no conversion needed. Three more
// real byte arrays exist verbatim in the upstream source (an unnumbered
// generic `pC`/`pN`/`pPC` sprite trio, declared between p6 and p7) but are
// never referenced by upstream's own real `clients[NB_CLIENT]` table
// (which only ever indexes p1..p17) - confirmed genuinely dead/unused
// leftover art, not a missed 18th client, and not ported here.
//
// Every real `gb.display.drawBitmap(...)` call site now has a direct
// `gbDrawBitmap()` counterpart at upstream's own exact real coordinates -
// no rotation/flip is used anywhere in this game (upstream never calls the
// 5-argument overload), so only the plain `gbDrawBitmap(x,y,bitmap)` form
// is needed. Every screen here draws onto a freshly-cleared (plain white)
// frame every tick with no persistent background layer underneath any
// sprite (`gbUpdate()`'s own automatic per-tick `gbClear()`) - so, unlike
// FlappyBirdo/Parachute, there is no mask/fill-underneath-outline bug class
// to check for here: every bitmap this game draws is self-contained, with
// nothing behind it that could bleed through.
//
// STRUCTS AVOIDED BY CHOICE, NOT BY DIALECT LIMITATION: upstream's own
// `Gout`/`Client` typedef structs (an icon pointer bundled with
// price/stock/mood fields) were ported as parallel `int`/`int*` arrays
// instead of a real Vircon32 struct array, even though
// `VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md` confirms named struct arrays with nested
// initializer lists do genuinely compile (`struct Name {...}; Name[3] arr
// = {{...},{...}};`) - this is a deliberate, defensive choice, not a
// dialect gap: no other game shipped in this project has used a struct yet
// (zero local precedent to lean on, and this project's own toolchain isn't
// reachable from this session to compile-test against), whereas the
// `int*[N] name = { bmpA, bmpB, ... }` array-of-bitmap-pointers pattern
// used here for `glaciGoutSprite`/`glaciPotSprite`/`glaciClientN/C/PC` is
// already proven and shipped (`gameUfoRace.c`'s own `int*[UFO_NUM_SPRITES]
// ufoSprites`). Every real `allGout[i].sprite`/`.prix`/`.nbStock`/
// `.prixAchat`/`allPots[i].*`/`clients[i].sprite[k]` upstream call site
// became a plain parallel-array index instead.
//
// Upstream's own blocking `gb.titleScreen(TitleScreen)` (called once at
// boot) became an explicit `GLACI_STATE_TITLE`, dismissed by a genuine
// fresh Button A press, matching every other ported game's own title
// screen in this project (see gamePong.c's own header comment). Upstream's
// own blocking `gb.menu(menu, 3)` (a real, built-in Gamebuino Classic
// list-menu widget with no equivalent here, used to pick a difficulty that
// sets the starting `cagnotte`) became `GLACI_STATE_DIFFICULTY`, a small
// hand-rolled up/down/A list - the same "blocking widget -> explicit
// state" treatment already used for `gameConduit.c`'s own
// `COND_STATE_MENU` (upstream's own `gb.menu()` there too) and
// `gameFlappyBirdo.c`'s own difficulty picker.
//
// Two MORE real blocking calls existed here that neither Pong nor Conduit
// needed a precedent for: upstream's own `affichageJour()`/
// `affichageFinJour()` are each a full second `while(true){if(gb.update())
// {...}}` loop (a real day-start/day-end splash, shown for up to 80 real
// frames or until dismissed early by Button A) called *from inside* the
// `PREPARE_TEMPS`/`FIN_DEPART_CLIENT` cases of the outer, real, top-level
// `loop()`'s own `switch(gameState)`. Both became their own explicit
// states (`GLACI_STATE_DAYINTRO`/`GLACI_STATE_DAYEND`), each with a local
// `glaciSplashFrames` counter standing in for the blocking loop's own local
// `cpt` counter, dismissed the same two ways upstream's own loop was
// (`glaciSplashFrames==80` or a fresh Button A press).
//
// Upstream's own top-level `if(gb.buttons.pressed(BTN_C)){goTitleScreen();}`
// check runs unconditionally at the very top of the real `loop()`, *before*
// its own `switch(gameState)` - but since `goTitleScreen()` itself is
// blocking (title screen, then the difficulty menu, both fully resolved
// before the call returns), a genuine Button C press during real gameplay
// immediately freezes the current screen and jumps straight into that
// whole blocking title+menu flow, only re-entering the switch once a fresh
// game has actually been set up. This global "Button C = full restart"
// shortcut is preserved here too, applied to every one of this port's own
// "real loop() case" states (`PREPARE_TEMPS`/`MAGASIN`/`CHOIX_CLIENT`/
// `ARRIVE_CLIENT`/`CHOIX_VENDEUR`/`DEPART_CLIENT_CALC`/`DEPART_CLIENT`/
// `FIN_DEPART_CLIENT`/`GAME_OVER`) exactly matching which states upstream's
// own single top-level `switch` covers - but deliberately NOT wired into
// `GLACI_STATE_TITLE`/`DIFFICULTY`/`DAYINTRO`/`DAYEND`, matching upstream
// exactly too (those four all correspond to upstream's OWN separate
// blocking calls, each with no Button C check of their own either).
//
// A REAL UPSTREAM DATA-PERSISTENCE QUIRK, PRESERVED: `initGame()` (ported
// as `glaciBeginDifficultyMenu()`) only ever resets `allGout[]`'s own
// `nbStock` field (12 literal, explicit `allGout[N].nbStock = ...`
// assignments) - it never touches `allPots[]`'s own `nbStock` at all. Real
// `allPots[NB_POT] = {{0,9,1,pot}, {1,0,2,cornet}, {2,0,2,luxeCornet}}`'s
// own `9,0,0` starting stock is therefore a real C/C++ static initializer
// that only ever actually runs once, at real program start - a full
// restart via Button C mid-game, or via pressing A on the real Game Over
// screen (both of which re-run `initGame()`), genuinely carries over
// whatever cone/cornet/luxe-cornet stock was left over from the PREVIOUS
// playthrough instead of resetting it to 9/0/0. Reproduced exactly:
// `glaciPotStock[]` is only ever seeded with `{9,0,0}` once, in
// `gameGlaciGlaca_init()` (this port's own one-time "real program start"
// equivalent - see `portVircon32.c`'s own dispatch loop, which calls a
// game's `_init()` fresh every single time it's chosen from the top-level
// menu) - `glaciBeginDifficultyMenu()` itself resets `glaciGoutStock[]`
// (matching upstream's own 12 explicit assignments) but never touches
// `glaciPotStock[]`, exactly like upstream's own `initGame()`.
//
// A REAL UPSTREAM BUG FOUND BUT *NOT* PRESERVED, since reproducing it
// literally would be a genuine out-of-bounds array write rather than a
// harmless leftover-state quirk: `updateChoixVendeur()`'s own cone-index
// wraparound reads `if(currentChoixInterface>=NB_POT){currentChoixInterface
// = 0;} else if(currentChoixInterface<0){currentChoixInterface = NB_POT;}`
// - the forward wrap correctly lands in-bounds at index 0, but the
// backward wrap lands at index `NB_POT` (3) itself, one PAST the real
// 3-element `allPots[0..2]` array, unlike the symmetric, genuinely correct
// modulo wraparound the flavor-selection code just below it uses
// (`currentChoixInterface = NB_GOUT + currentChoixInterface` - never lands
// out of bounds). On real hardware this is already a real out-of-bounds
// struct-array read *and write* (`allPots[3].nbStock--` on a genuine
// Button A press at that index, corrupting whatever real SRAM byte happens
// to sit right after the `allPots` array) - not a "wrap to an
// intentionally-unreachable slot" design, just a plain off-by-one typo
// (the sibling flavor-selection wraparound, 6 lines below in the same real
// function, gets this right). This project's own norm is to preserve real,
// reachable bugs rather than silently "fix" them - but every other
// preserved bug in this project so far (Conduit's AVR-underflow-as-
// implicit-bounds-check, Catcher's Button-C soft-lock) leaves behind
// harmless stale *state*, never an actual out-of-bounds memory write into
// an adjacent global whose real identity depends entirely on this port's
// own unrelated declaration order (a plain `int[3] glaciPotStock` here,
// not a packed AVR struct array) - so the "reproduced" consequence
// wouldn't even be a recognizable analog of the real bug, just an
// unrelated stray global silently corrupted. Fixed here to wrap to
// `GLACI_NB_POT - 1` (the same correct treatment already used one branch
// over), rather than porting forward a genuine memory-safety hazard for no
// faithful behavioral gain.
//
// A genuinely dead, result-discarded upstream call, dropped outright: the
// real `CHOIX_VENDEUR` case calls `verrifCanServClient()` a SECOND time,
// right after `printCagnotte()`, with its own return value completely
// unused (the function is pure/read-only, so this second call has zero
// effect on anything) - not ported, matching this project's own precedent
// for the same category of leftover call (Conduit's own dead `count` debug
// variable).
//
// The real `STATS` game-state value is declared, and has its own (empty)
// case in upstream's own top-level `switch` - but nothing anywhere in the
// real source ever actually sets `gameState = STATS`, so it's genuinely
// unreachable. Dropped outright rather than porting a dead enum value.
//
// A REAL FONT-STATE "LEAK" BETWEEN SCREENS, PRESERVED EXACTLY: upstream's
// own `drawArriveClient()`/`drawChoixVendeur()` never call `setFont()`
// themselves, so each one draws with whatever font a DIFFERENT, earlier
// screen happened to leave selected - real hardware's font is one
// persistent global, not a per-screen setting. Concretely: the very first
// client of a given day sees its own greeting message rendered in the tiny
// `font3x3` (leftover from `drawMagasin()`'s own explicit
// `setFont(font3x3)`, since nothing resets it before `drawArriveClient()`
// runs), while every client after that instead inherits `font3x5`
// (leftover from the PREVIOUS client's own `drawDepartClient()`, which
// *does* call `setFont(font3x5)` explicitly). This port reproduces the
// exact same leak by likewise never inserting an extra `gbSetFont()` call
// into `glaciDrawArriveClient()`/`glaciDrawChoixVendeur()` - this shim's
// own font state is just as global/persistent as real hardware's, so the
// same inconsistency naturally falls out of the same real call-site gaps.
//
// Upstream's own `println()`-based multi-line text blocks
// (`affichageFinJour()`'s 3-line splash, `drawGameOver()`'s 2-line tally)
// were rewritten as separate `gbPrintString()`/`gbPrintNumber()` calls with
// the cursor explicitly repositioned between lines (`gbCursorX = 0;
// gbCursorY = gbCursorY + gbFontSize*gbFontHeight;`, matching
// `gbPrintString()`'s own real `'\n'`-handling formula exactly) rather than
// a single string literal embedding a literal `\n` - matching this
// project's own established precedent of not relying on `'\n'` inside a
// quoted string literal (see `gameFlappyBirdo.c`'s own header comment: its
// difficulty screen's real two-`'\n'` text block was likewise expanded
// into one `gbPrintString()` call per line).
//
// Real octal-escape icon glyphs (`"\34"` = octal 34 = decimal 28, a coin/
// currency icon printed after every real cagnotte amount; `"\02"`/`"\01"`
// = decimal 2/1, the real happy/unhappy client-tally icons on the Game
// Over screen) are non-printable low-ASCII codes a quoted string literal
// can't hold directly - `"\34"` alone (no other text sharing the same
// literal) is drawn with a single direct `gbDrawChar(28, x, y)` call,
// exactly the "single non-text glyph" use case documented on
// `gbDrawChar()`'s own header comment; the one real mixed case (upstream's
// `print("\34 les 3")`, an icon plus trailing printable text in one
// literal) was built as a small explicit `int[]` array instead, matching
// the same established precedent as `gameTaquin.c`'s own D-pad-arrow
// array/`gameSimonbuino.c`'s own reset-icon array.
//
// This game needs real `INVERT` (used upstream to blink the currently-
// selected shop item/UI button by XOR-toggling whatever's already drawn
// underneath it, not painting a flat fill). Ported via the shim's own
// `GB_INVERT` color constant
// (every drawing primitive's own color branch XORs the target bit when
// `gbColor == GB_INVERT`), so every call site here just does
// `gbSetColor(GB_INVERT); gbFillRect(...);` like real upstream's own
// `setColor(INVERT); fillRect(...);` pairing.
//
// Upstream reads `gb.frameCount` (a real, free-running frame counter
// exposed by the real Gamebuino Classic library) to blink the shop/vendor
// selection cursor (`gb.frameCount % 10 > 4`). Ported here via the shim's
// own `gbFrameCount` global (incremented once per real logic tick inside
// `gbUpdate()`, matching real hardware's own placement).
//
// No EEPROM persistence is used - upstream never touches real EEPROM
// either (there's no cross-session high score here, just a single
// in-session `cagnotte`/day counter).
