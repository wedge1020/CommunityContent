// Jezzball (RackhamLeNoir, GPLv3 - github.com/RackhamLeNoir/gamebuino-jezzball,
// real LICENSE file confirmed). Same author as this project's already-ported
// gameTaquin.c. A JezzBall/Qix-style game: a cursor walks around an
// otherwise-empty rectangular playfield full of bouncing balls; Button A
// fires a wall (a growing line, horizontal or vertical depending on Button
// B's toggle) from the cursor's position, splitting whatever board it's
// standing in into two; a wall that finishes growing without ever being hit
// by a ball permanently claims whichever of the two resulting halves ends up
// with no balls left in it (scored as claimed area), while a wall a ball
// touches mid-growth costs a life instead. Clearing 2300 (LEVELCLEAR)
// cumulative claimed-area units in a level advances to the next (one more
// ball, up to a real cap of 15); running out of lives ends the game.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (this dialect has no classes/methods - see
// gamebuinoShim.h's own header comment). `random(N)` became `arand(N)`,
// `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became the documented `gbPickRandomSeed()` no-op,
// and `gb.battery.show = false;` was dropped outright - all matching this
// whole project's own established precedent (see gamePong.c's own header
// comment). Arduino's `constrain(v,lo,hi)` macro has no equivalent here (no
// ternary operator in this dialect either, so a `(a>b?a:b)`-style macro
// wouldn't have compiled) - replaced by a small local `jezzClamp()` helper
// built from the real `gbMax()`/`gbMin()` primitives, the same treatment
// gamePong.c/gameConduit.c already use for `max()`/`min()`. `numlength()`
// (upstream's own `floor(log10(number))+1`-based digit-count helper) was
// reimplemented via `itoa()` instead, matching gameTaquin.c's own
// `taqNumLength()` precedent exactly (this dialect has no readily available
// `log10()`, and itoa-based counting is simpler anyway) - the itoa version
// also naturally handles `number==0` correctly without upstream's own
// separate special case, since `score`/`level`/`percent` are all real
// non-negative counters here (upstream declares them all `unsigned int`),
// so no negative-number handling was needed either.
//
// FLATTENING FOUR REAL CLASSES (Ball/Board/Line/Cursor) INTO STRUCTS +
// INDEX-BASED SLICES: upstream's `Board` objects share ONE dynamically
// `malloc()`'d array of `Ball*` per level (`Board::ballsarray`, sized to
// that level's own ball count) - each `Board` just remembers a `_balls`
// pointer into some contiguous sub-range of that shared array plus its own
// `_nbballs` count, and `Board::split()` partitions a board's own sub-range
// in place (swapping elements) into two adjacent sub-ranges when a wall
// finishes. This dialect has no `malloc()`/`new` (confirmed: no other
// ported game in this project uses them - every dynamic-count entity table
// so far, e.g. gameCatcher.c's own `CatchSprite[CATCH_MAX_SPRITES]`, is a
// real fixed-size array) and no pointer-into-array aliasing trick to lean
// on either, so this port instead uses one fixed `JezzBall[JEZZ_MAXBALLS]`
// array (15 slots, matching upstream's own real `Ball::maxballs=15` cap)
// shared by every board, with each `JezzBoard` struct storing `ballStart`/
// `nbBalls` (an absolute index + count into that shared array) instead of a
// pointer - functionally identical to upstream's own pointer-into-shared-
// array scheme, just index-based. `jezzBoardSplit()` below reproduces
// upstream's own real in-place partition/swap loop index-for-index (see its
// own comment for the exact mapping). `JezzBoard[JEZZ_MAXBOARDS]` (15 slots
// too - upstream's own comment states directly "there cannot be more boards
// than balls", confirmed true by construction: a genuine second board only
// ever persists when a split leaves at least one ball on each side, so the
// total board count can never exceed the total ball count, itself capped at
// 15). `Line`/`Cursor` (upstream: one single global instance of each,
// singleton objects, never more than one at a time) became plain flat
// globals with no struct at all - one wall and one cursor exist at once,
// full stop.
//
// A GENUINE, UNREPRODUCIBLE UNDEFINED-BEHAVIOR BUG FOUND IN UPSTREAM'S OWN
// `Board::split()`, HANDLED BY IMPLEMENTING ITS CLEAR INTENT INSTEAD: real
// `Board::split()` is declared to return `Board*`, but NO code path in its
// real body (board.cpp) ever executes an explicit `return <value>;` - the
// only `return` at all is a bare `return;` on its very first line (itself
// only reachable if `!line.finished()`, which can never be true anyway,
// since `split()` is only ever called from loop() immediately after an
// explicit `if (line.finished())` check already passed - so this bare
// early return is dead code on top of being invalid for a non-void
// function). Every other path (the empty-new-board merge, the empty-
// original-board merge, and the genuine two-survivors case) falls off the
// end of the function entirely, an actual C++ undefined-behavior case (not
// a "real bug with defined, if surprising, behavior" like several other
// preserved-verbatim upstream quirks elsewhere in this project) - the
// returned pointer is simply whatever garbage avr-gcc happened to leave in
// its return register on real hardware, un-knowable without a real
// disassembly and not meaningfully "the same undefined behavior" on a
// different compiler/architecture even if one were done. Compounding this,
// loop()'s own caller does `Board *newboard = boards[...]->split(line); if
// (newboard) { boards[nbboards] = newboard; nbboards++; }` - genuinely
// double-booking the just-created board and incrementing `nbboards` a
// SECOND time relative to `split()`'s own already-complete internal
// bookkeeping (`nbboards++` already happens inside `split()`'s own real
// two-survivors branch) IF that indeterminate return value were ever
// observed as truthy. Since true UB has no "real" behavior this port could
// faithfully preserve byte-for-byte (unlike, say, an unsigned wraparound or
// an off-by-one, which have one single well-defined outcome on any
// compliant compiler), `jezzBoardSplit()` below instead implements
// `Board::split()`'s own CLEAR, unambiguous intent exactly once - partition
// the shared ball array, then either merge back (award area, keep one
// board) or keep both (award a smaller per-split bonus, increment the board
// count once) - and this port's own caller does NOT separately re-add a
// board or re-increment the count the way upstream's own loop() body
// would, since doing so would only reproduce a bug, not upstream's real,
// observable behavior.
//
// A GENUINE EEPROM ADDRESS TYPO, FOUND AND FIXED (not preserved):
// `get_highscore()`'s own magic-byte mismatch handler is meant to re-stamp
// EEPROM addresses 0/1/2 with `magic[0..2]` (42/12/28) via `for (j=0;j<3;
// j++) EEPROM.put(0, magic[j]);` - note the hardcoded `0` where `j` was
// clearly intended, confirmed directly against the real board.cpp/
// jezzball.ino source, not a transcription slip introduced here. This meant
// the "reset" path could NEVER actually succeed at restamping all three
// magic bytes correctly - it just overwrote address 0 three times in a row
// (ending at `magic[2]`=28) and left addresses 1/2 untouched, so the very
// next boot's own magic check mismatched AGAIN (address 0 now reads 28, not
// 42) and re-entered the same broken "reset" path forever. Real, practical
// consequence, worked through rather than just noted: on a genuinely fresh
// (or previously-corrupted) card - which, per this project's own
// eepromShim.c convention, is exactly the state any card starts in (fresh
// cells default to 255, matching real AVR EEPROM's own factory-erased
// state) - this meant Jezzball's own highscore could NEVER actually persist
// across a save/reload on real hardware either, every single boot
// re-detecting a "corrupted" stamp and resetting `highscore` to 0. Flagged
// as a genuine negative player-experience bug and fixed: `jezzGetHighscore()`
// now writes `eeprom_update_byte( j, jezzMagic[ j ] )`, restamping all three
// addresses correctly, so a saved high score now genuinely survives a
// reload.
// `EEPROM.get`/`EEPROM.put` (byte and 2-byte-`unsigned int` overloads) were
// ported to this shim's own `eeprom_read_byte()`/`eeprom_update_byte()`/
// `eeprom_read_word()`/`eeprom_write_word()` (this dialect has no classes to
// preserve the real `EEPROM` object's own dot-call syntax) - `get_
// highscore()`'s own declared-but-never-actually-returned `unsigned int`
// return value (itself ANOTHER real "falls off the end of a non-void
// function" case, this time genuinely harmless since its only real caller,
// `setup()`, calls it as a bare statement and never reads the result) was
// ported as a plain `void` function instead, matching the only way its
// result is ever actually used - not a behavior change, since nothing on
// real hardware ever reads that indeterminate value either.
//
// BLOCKING `gb.titleScreen(F(""), logo)` -> AN EXPLICIT, REUSED
// JEZZ_STATE_TITLE: upstream calls this exact same real blocking function
// (same empty name, same logo bitmap) from FOUR places - once in setup()
// (the initial boot splash) and once more from each of inputsgame()/
// inputsgameover()/inputslevelclear()'s own unconditional Button-C check
// (a genuine "return to the splash, then resume exactly where you left
// off" gesture, since none of those call sites touch any board/score/level
// state before or after the blocking call). Ported as ONE shared
// JEZZ_STATE_TITLE (matching gamePong.c's/gameTaquin.c's own "blocking
// titleScreen() -> explicit resumable state" treatment) reused for all four
// real entry points, with a `jezzFirstBoot` flag gating the ONE real
// difference between them: only the very first-ever dismissal (matching
// upstream's own setup(), which runs `gb.pickRandomSeed(); ...
// get_highscore(); preparelevel();` immediately AFTER its own title screen
// call returns) loads the highscore and prepares the first level - every
// later title visit (a mid-game Button-C pause) just resumes whatever state
// (playing / game-over / level-clear) was already active, exactly like
// upstream's own real board/score/level state surviving untouched across
// its own blocking call. Real `gb.titleScreen()`'s own internal caption/
// logo layout isn't available to read (it's a real library-internal
// function, only the logo bitmap and an empty name string were ever passed
// in) - so, matching this project's own established precedent for the same
// situation (see gameKillrace.c's own header comment), this port draws its
// own simple layout instead: the real logo bitmap (restored bit-for-bit
// below, not a placeholder) centered near the top, plus a plain "PRESS A"
// prompt underneath, dismissed by a genuine fresh `gbPressed(BTN_A)` -
// Vircon32's own menu-select button, matching every other ported title
// screen in this project.
//
// A REAL EXECUTION-ORDER NUANCE FROM THE SAME BLOCKING-CALL CONVERSION:
// upstream's own loop() normal-play branch runs `updategame(); inputsgame();
// drawgame();` in that exact order every tick - so on the exact tick Button
// C is pressed, `updategame()` (ball movement, wall growth/collision, wall-
// finish splitting) has ALREADY run for that tick before inputsgame()'s own
// blocking titleScreen() call takes over; only that one tick's own
// `drawgame()` call is what real hardware defers until AFTER the title
// screen is later dismissed (an artifact of a blocking call being
// interleavable mid-tick that a non-blocking engine has no way to
// reproduce - see gameKillrace.c's own header comment for this exact same
// situation and the same "return immediately, skip the rest of this tick's
// draw" resolution used here too). `jezzUpdatePlay()`'s own normal-play
// branch below preserves the real part of this ordering (ball movement/
// wall growth genuinely still happens on a tick where C gets pressed) while
// skipping only the now-meaningless "draw, then immediately overwrite with
// a title screen" artifact.
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED: the 64x30 title/menu logo (`jezzLogoBitmap`)
// was converted byte-for-byte from its real Arduino `B00000000`-style
// binary literals (`logo[]` in jezzball.ino) into this dialect's own
// `int[N] name = { width, height, 0x.., ... }` shape `gbDrawBitmap()`
// expects, via a small script that parsed jezzball.ino's own literal
// source text directly (not hand-transcribed) and verified the resulting
// byte count (240 = ceil(64/8) x 30) against the real declared width/
// height before trusting it - the same discipline gameFlappyBirdo.c's own
// header comment describes. No separate mask/fill layer exists for it
// upstream (a single self-contained outline bitmap, confirmed directly in
// jezzball.ino - no GRAY-body/BLACK-outline layering to restore), so its
// one `gbDrawBitmap()` call is a single direct call with no background-
// bleed risk to guard against.
//
// TWO REAL GAMEBUINO ICON GLYPHS RESTORED AS REAL ASCII, NOT SUBSTITUTED
// TEXT: upstream's own octal escapes `"\03"` (a life/heart icon, printed
// once per remaining life), `"\17"` (a decorative icon bracketing a new
// high score), and `"\25"` (the same D-pad-arrow "press to continue" icon
// gameTaquin.c's own `taqRestartText` already restores) are real Gamebuino
// custom low-ASCII glyphs (decimal 3/15/21 respectively) this shim's real
// font tables already cover in full (ASCII 0-127) - drawn directly via
// `gbDrawChar()`/`gbPrintString()` with their real decimal codes, exactly
// like real hardware, rather than substituted with plain text the way this
// project's font-table gap used to force before real fonts existed.
//
// A REAL, PRESERVED SINGLETON-OBJECT QUIRK: upstream's own `Cursor cursor;`
// is a single global C++ object, constructed exactly ONCE, ever (at
// program start, before setup() even runs) - `preparelevel()` (called at
// initial boot, and again on every level-up/restart) never touches it.
// This means the cursor's own on-screen position and current wall
// orientation genuinely persist across level transitions and full-game
// restarts on real hardware, never recentered. Ported the same way: this
// port's own `jezzCursorX`/`Y`/`Horizontal` globals are initialized exactly
// once, in `gameJezzball_init()`, and never touched again by
// `jezzPrepareLevel()`/`jezzClearLevel()` - matching real hardware exactly,
// not "fixed" into a more intuitive per-level recenter real hardware never
// actually does either.
//
// Upstream draws the cursor with `gb.display.setColor(INVERT)` (a real
// XOR-style compositing mode - the cursor line inverts whatever's already
// on screen underneath it, so it stays visible over both the black
// "claimed" background and the white "still in play" board interior),
// ported directly as `gbSetColor(GB_INVERT)`.
//
// SOUND: upstream's own Ball class calls `gb.sound.playTick()` on every
// wall bounce, ball-vs-ball bounce, and ball-vs-wall-under-construction
// collision - the only sound call anywhere in this game's own source
// (confirmed directly - no `playNote`/`playOK`/`playCancel` anywhere in
// jezzball.ino/ball.cpp/board.cpp/line.cpp/cursor.cpp) - ported as a direct,
// unmodified `gbPlayTick()` at every one of those same real call sites.
