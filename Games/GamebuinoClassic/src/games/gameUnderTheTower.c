// Under the Tower (wuuff, GPLv3 - github.com/wuuff/under-the-tower, author
// confirmed directly via the real repo's own git history/remote, not
// guessed). A real turn-based RPG: an overworld town to walk around (real
// door-triggered transitions into interior "dungeons"), 10 real dungeons
// with procedurally-generated room layouts (a recursive BSP-style
// splitter, same shape ported here unmodified), random wandering-monster
// encounters plus real scripted boss fights and dialogue events tied to a
// single linear `game_status[STATUS_MAIN]` main-quest counter (plus five
// smaller side-quest counters), a 3-member party (Mudlark/Shadow/Nurse,
// the latter two recruited over the course of the story), a menu-driven
// battle system (attack/ability/item/run), and real EEPROM save/load.
//
// Ported as a flat, single-file state machine, matching this project's own
// established "flatten a real single-instance C/C++ game into plain C
// globals/functions" treatment - every real upstream file (overworld/
// dungeon/battle/dialogue/events/save .ino+.h) is folded in here under one
// `utt` prefix (this dialect has no per-file namespacing and the whole
// cartridge is one translation unit sharing one flat global namespace, so
// every real upstream #define/global needed renaming - RAT/WORLD/UP/DOOR/
// SHADOW/etc are all real, generic names that would otherwise collide with
// some other already-shipped game's own globals).
//
// DIALECT REWRITES:
// - No ternary operator anywhere in this dialect - every real upstream
//   `a?b:c` (menu-limit clamps, spawn-pool indexing, the `random(3)` vs
//   `random(2)` vs `0` enemy-target pick) rewritten as if/else.
// - `char dungeon_map[16][16]` (and every function that took it as a
//   `map[][MAPSIZE]` parameter) was flattened to one global 1D
//   `uttDungeonMap[256]` (`UTT_MAPIDX(row,col)` indexing) - there is only
//   ever one active dungeon at a time, so no parameter was needed at all
//   once flattened; this also sidesteps ever needing to pass a 2D array as
//   a function parameter, a pattern with no proven precedent anywhere in
//   this project's own history.
// - Every real upstream `struct` with more than one field (character
//   party stats, the enemy-buffer, the dungeon table's own per-entry
//   `spawns[3]`, the dialogue/boss event tables) was flattened to parallel
//   scalar arrays (`uttPartyLevel[3]`/`uttPartyHealth[3]`/etc) rather than
//   real struct types - not because structs themselves are unsupported
//   (they are - see e.g. gameFirebuino.c's own struct-free plain-array
//   style, or other ported games' real struct usage elsewhere), but
//   specifically because a real upstream `spawns[3]`-style ARRAY-typed
//   struct FIELD has no proven-working precedent in this project (flagged
//   explicitly as a deliberately-untested pattern during gamebuino-
//   solitaire's own port) - parallel arrays sidestep the question
//   entirely rather than being the first real test of it, given how much
//   state this one file already has to get right.
// - Real upstream's `const char name[][8]` string tables (player/enemy
//   names, menu labels, combat message fragments, item names) were ported
//   as real `int[N][8]` tables of explicit per-character ASCII codes
//   (proven-safe 2D numeric arrays, matching every other ported game's own
//   `int[N][8]`-shaped sound-effect/bitmap tables) rather than betting on
//   an unproven "string literal initializes one nested array row"
//   shorthand. Since a function can't take "which 2D table" as a generic
//   array-of-arrays parameter either, `uttNameChar(table,row,col)` (a
//   small `if`-chain over a `UTT_TBL_*` selector constant) replaces every
//   real upstream call site that used to pass `player_names`/
//   `enemy_names`/etc directly as an argument (`copy_to_buffer()`/
//   `append_to_msg_buffer()`/`display_dialogue()` all gained a `table`
//   parameter in place of their own real array parameter).
// - Real upstream's `F("\20")` (a Gamebuino icon-glyph escape, the cursor-
//   arrow bitmap builtin to font5x7/font3x5) can't live inside a quoted
//   string literal here - ported as an explicit `int[2] uttArrowIcon =
//   {16,0}` (ASCII 16 = the real glyph code), matching this project's own
//   already-established Taquin/Simonbuino/SpinSpinSpinbuino precedent for
//   the exact same real gap.
// - Real upstream's run-length-encoded `world[]` overworld map and the
//   huffman-compressed `dialogue[]`/`huff_tree[]` text-compression tables
//   were extracted byte-for-byte from the real PROGMEM data (every
//   `B01111111`-style Arduino binary literal converted straight to hex,
//   verified element counts against the real source before trusting them)
//   rather than re-derived or approximated - both are still real,
//   functioning run-length/huffman decoders here, ported as literal
//   algorithms operating on the same literal compressed bytes real
//   hardware ships.
//
// PLATFORM-FORCED FIXES (behavior changed from real upstream because the
// original would risk a crash/hang/undefined-memory-read on this platform
// specifically - not because it "looked wrong"):
// - **`COMPRESSED_SIZE` (2652) doesn't match the real `world[]` array's
//   own actual element count (2630, counted directly, not assumed)** - a
//   real, pre-existing upstream mismatch. On real AVR, `world_get()`'s own
//   search loop reads up to 22 bytes past the real array's own end before
//   giving up (harmless-in-practice PROGMEM overread on real hardware,
//   same class of issue as this project's own previously-documented
//   Pirates sprite-state OOB read). `uttWorldGet()` instead bounds its
//   search to the real, measured 2630-element size and returns a safe
//   fallback tile (`UTT_OW_WATER`, matching the real data's own trailing
//   filler tile) if the search ever exhausts the real data without
//   finding the requested index, rather than reading adjacent unrelated
//   globals.
// - **`NUM_DUNGEONS` (18) doesn't match the real `dungeons[]` table's own
//   actual entry count (12, counted directly from the real, uncommented
//   array - several more entries exist only inside a `/* ... */`-commented
//   alternate revision that was never compiled)** - another real upstream
//   mismatch. `uttStepWorld()`'s own door-to-dungeon lookup loop is
//   bounded to `UTT_NUM_DUNGEONS` (12, the real corrected count) instead,
//   avoiding a real 6-entry overread into whatever unrelated global
//   happens to sit next in memory.
// - **`uttCheckProximity()`'s own row-scan loop bound (`i+1+extra`, real
//   upstream `check_proximity()`) can read one row past `dungeon_map[16]
//   [16]`'s own real 0-15 range when called with `extra==1` near the
//   bottom map edge** - a real, if narrow, upstream OOB read (confirmed by
//   tracing the actual loop bounds against the real 16-row array, not
//   assumed). Fixed by skipping any row index outside 0-15 rather than
//   reading it.
// - **`uttMapExits()`'s three real `while(1)` random-placement retry loops
//   (entrance door / stairs down / stairs up) have no upper bound on real
//   hardware at all** - provably safe in practice given how the real
//   recursive room generator behaves, but a genuine unbounded-loop hang
//   risk in principle if a future map-gen change ever left no valid
//   placement at all. Each loop is now capped at 1000 attempts with a
//   guaranteed-safe fallback placement, matching this project's own
//   established "avoid a real hang, even one accepted as very unlikely on
//   paper" precedent - the cap is high enough to never actually change
//   real behavior in normal generation.
// - **A real division/modulo-by-zero hard-trap risk in `uttDoCombat()`'s
//   own cursor-wrap `combat_selection %= mod;`** - `mod` is provably >=1
//   under every real reachable game state (the ENEMY_MENU is only ever
//   entered while at least one enemy is still alive), but this platform
//   hard-traps the CPU on an actual division/modulo by zero rather than
//   silently producing garbage the way real AVR might - a defensive
//   `if(mod<1) mod=1;` guard was added purely as insurance against a
//   crash, not because the unguarded value was ever observed to reach
//   zero.
//
// A real, previously-undocumented int8_t-narrowing hazard, audited and
// fixed exactly per this project's own established EEPROM-narrowing
// methodology: real upstream's `game_status[]` is a genuine `int8_t`
// array whose very first element starts at -1 (`{-1,0,0,0,0,0}`, "quest
// not yet started"). Real `EEPROM.update(addr,int8_t)` implicitly narrows
// -1 to the byte 0xFF on write, and real `int8_t x = EEPROM.read(addr);`
// (an EEPROM.read() call assigned into a genuinely 8-bit signed variable)
// narrows 0xFF back to -1 on read - this dialect's own always-32-bit
// `int` never narrows either way, so a naive port would instead save 0xFF
// (255, correctly) but then load it back as +255, not -1, silently
// corrupting the "quest not started" sentinel into an unreachable status
// value forever after the very first save/load round-trip. Fixed with a
// small `uttNarrowS8()` helper (mirroring real AVR int8_t narrowing
// exactly: any raw byte >127 becomes `value-256`) applied to every
// `game_status[]` byte on load, and `& 0xFF` masking on save (already
// correct either way for a plain byte write, kept explicit for clarity).
// No other persisted value in this game is ever genuinely negative
// (health/level/xp/inventory/coordinates are all real non-negative
// `uint8_t`/`uint16_t` on real hardware), so this is the one and only
// real narrow-int save/load divergence this game has.
//
// UPSTREAM QUIRKS PRESERVED DELIBERATELY (confirmed real, not accidental,
// by tracing the actual logic rather than assumed):
// - `uttTestWorldCollision()`'s own UP-direction branch returns the real
//   raw tile value (needed to distinguish a real door tile from a plain
//   wall), while DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT return a plain boolean - a real, genuine
//   asymmetry (only building entrances, approached from below, need door
//   detection at all), not a bug, ported exactly as upstream wrote it.
// - `uttLoadEnemyData()`'s own boss branch unconditionally resets
//   `uttMetaMode` back to `UTT_DUNGEON` after loading the boss into the
//   combat's own center slot - meaning if `uttGenEnemies()`'s own 50/50
//   coin-flip then decides to also spawn a left/right companion, THOSE
//   calls see `uttMetaMode==UTT_DUNGEON` already and pull a normal,
//   dungeon-appropriate mook instead of a second boss copy. A real,
//   deliberate-reading-confirmed upstream quirk (a boss fight can
//   genuinely have 1-2 regular extra enemies alongside the real boss),
//   preserved exactly.
// - Real upstream's own `restore_game()` sets `mode=TO_WORLD` on a
//   successful load WITHOUT resetting `transition` to `-SCREEN_HEIGHT/2`
//   first - since `transition` is left over from whatever it last settled
//   at (>=0, either its untouched initial 0 on a fresh boot, or wherever
//   it stopped changing after the last real transition completed), the
//   real wipe-in animation never actually plays on a loaded game; the
//   world just cuts in instantly. A genuine, if minor, real upstream
//   oversight, preserved rather than "fixed" into a different experience
//   than real hardware ships.
// - Real `mapinit()`'s own border-wall loop rewrites the same four border
//   cells on every single inner-loop iteration (16x for each of the 16
//   outer iterations) instead of once - genuinely wasteful but harmless,
//   real upstream's own header comment already calls this out
//   ("Less runtime efficiency, but more space efficiency putting this
//   here") - ported exactly, not "optimized away".
// - The real VICTORY/DEFEAT message-dismiss branches inside `do_combat()`
//   both `return` immediately with NO trailing `drawRect()` call, unlike
//   every other path through the function, which falls through to one at
//   the very end - a real, if cosmetically minor, upstream quirk (the
//   combat divider rect just isn't freshly redrawn on the exact tick
//   victory/defeat is confirmed) - preserved exactly, not smoothed over.
//
// SIMPLIFIED FROM REAL UPSTREAM, DOCUMENTED RATHER THAN SILENTLY DROPPED:
// - Real upstream's scene transitions rely on real `gb.display.
//   persistence` (freeze the CPU framebuffer, don't auto-clear it every
//   tick) to let the growing/shrinking black wipe animation
//   (`step_transition()`) draw over a genuinely frozen previous scene for
//   the first half of the animation. This shim has no persistence concept
//   at all (`gbUpdate()` always clears+redraws every real tick, matching
//   every other game in this cartridge). The real INPUT-PROCESSING gate
//   (`if(transition>=0){...}`, which also stops the player from moving or
//   the dungeon regenerating while transition<0) is preserved byte-for-
//   byte - so there is zero gameplay-logic difference from real hardware.
//   The one real, deliberate, documented visual difference: during the
//   first half of a transition, this port's own screen shows the wipe
//   lines drawn over a blank cleared background rather than over a frozen
//   copy of the previous scene (no per-pixel snapshot/restore was
//   implemented for what is a purely cosmetic ~6-tick effect, given how
//   large this file already is) - the wipe's own signature growing/
//   shrinking black-bar shape, and its real per-case draw ordering
//   (world/dungeon draw UNDER the wipe, but combat draws OVER the wipe -
//   "Draw first to avoid the text overdrawing the transition", a real
//   upstream comment, preserved exactly), are both otherwise unchanged.
// - Real upstream's `gb.pickRandomSeed()`/`gb.changeGame()` (an SD-card
//   multi-cartridge menu handoff, triggered by the MAIN_MENU's own real
//   "QUIT" option) have no Vircon32 equivalent - `gbPickRandomSeed()` is
//   this shim's own already-established no-op (see gamebuinoShim.h), and
//   "QUIT" itself is left a deliberate no-op menu entry, matching this
//   project's own established precedent (gamePirates.c's own real
//   `load_game()` drop) that the cartridge's own global Start-button
//   quit-confirmation dialog already provides the equivalent "return to
//   the shared menu" functionality project-wide.
//
// No custom per-pixel bitmap-masking helper was needed anywhere in this
// port - every real upstream `drawBitmap()` call here draws a genuinely
// self-contained, non-mask-dependent sprite (matching `gbDrawBitmap()`
// directly, 1:1), unlike e.g. FlappyBirdo's/Pirates' own real outline-
// plus-mask sprite layers. No collision/hit-detection in this game
// depends on sprite facing/flip direction either - verified directly by
// reading `overworld.ino`/`dungeon.ino`/`battle.ino` in full: every real
// collision check here is a plain 4-directional tile lookahead
// (`uttTestWorldCollision()`/`uttTestCollision()`, checking the single
// tile the player is about to step into) or a pure turn-based menu
// selection in combat (no positional hitboxes of any kind) - there is no
// real-time movement collision or facing-dependent hurtbox anywhere in
// this game to get wrong.
//
// Sound: every real upstream sound call in this game (`playTick()`/
// `playOK()`/`playCancel()`) already matches this shim's own supported
// one-shot repertoire exactly - no approximation was needed at all, a
// rare case among this project's larger ports.
