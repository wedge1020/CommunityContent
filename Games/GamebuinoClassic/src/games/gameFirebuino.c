// FireBuino! (Luis Alejandro Dominguez Bueno - LADBSoft, graphics by Erico
// Patricio Monteiro, LGPLv3 - github.com/ladbsoft/makerbuino-firebuino). A
// remake of the 1980 Game&Watch title "Fire!": two firemen hold a
// stretcher that slides across three lanes, catching people jumping from a
// burning building's windows and bouncing them into a waiting ambulance.
// Three misses (a survivor hits the ground) ends the game. Real source is
// two upstream `.ino` tabs sharing one real Arduino translation unit
// (FIRBUINO.ino/graphics.ino, both confirmed to exist and read in full
// before porting - no other source files in the staged directory besides
// the *.HEX/*.INF build artifacts).
//
// BOARD-COMPATIBILITY CHECK (per this port's own specific brief): this
// game targets MakerBuino hardware, a different-but-Gamebuino-Classic-API-
// compatible board. Its top-level `#include <Gamebuino.h>` is the real
// Gamebuino Classic library, not a MakerBuino-specific one, and a full
// read of both real source files found no MakerBuino-specific quirk at
// all - no accelerometer/tilt input, no non-standard button naming (only
// real `BTN_UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/A/B/C`), no display call outside the real
// `Display` API this shim already reproduces. Every real API surface used
// (`gb.begin()`, `gb.pickRandomSeed()`, `gb.battery.show`,
// `gb.titleScreen()`, `gb.menu()`, `gb.display.*`, `gb.buttons.pressed()`,
// `gb.sound.playTick()/playCancel()/playOK()`, `gb.getDefaultName()`,
// `gb.keyboard()`, `EEPROM.read()/write()`) is genuine, standard Gamebuino
// Classic API - this sketch happens to also run on MakerBuino because that
// board is itself built to be a drop-in-compatible clone, not because the
// sketch reaches for anything board-specific. No incompatibility to paper
// over.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site is mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (this dialect has no classes/methods - see
// gamePong.c's own header comment for the full reasoning). Upstream's own
// `byte`/`boolean` fields became plain `int` (this project's own
// established avrCompat.h convention; `boolean` itself isn't in
// avrCompat.h's own typedef list, so every real `boolean` field here was
// hand-converted to `int` the same way). `random(N)`/`random(min,max)`
// became `arand(N)`/`min + arand(max-min)`, preserving every real upstream
// range quirk exactly (see "Preserved real upstream behavior" below).
// Every real `B00000000`-style Arduino binary literal in `graphics.ino`
// (every bitmap/position table there uses this style; this file has no
// plain `0x` hex tables at all) was mechanically converted to decimal,
// byte-count verified against each table's own declared
// `{width,height,...}` header before being pasted in below. Global naming
// prefix: `fireb` (verified unused by every other game shipped or
// concurrently in flight in this project).
//
// CLASS Survivor -> FIXED STRUCT ARRAY WITH AN EXPLICIT "active" FLAG.
// Upstream's own `class Survivor` is a genuine dynamically-allocated
// object (`new`/`delete`, `Survivor* survivors[10]`, empty slots are real
// `NULL`) - this dialect has no classes/methods at all (confirmed via
// VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md), so `Survivor` becomes a plain `FirebSurvivor`
// struct, and the pointer array becomes `FirebSurvivor[FIREB_MAX_SURVIVORS]
// firebSurvivors` with a real `active` field standing in for upstream's
// own null-vs-non-null sentinel - matching this project's own established
// "fixed struct array + state flag" convention for every other upstream
// dynamic-object array already ported here (`AgarBall[]` in
// gameAgaruino.c, `FlapPipe[]` in gameFlappyBirdo.c, `CdefMonster[]` in
// gameCastleDefence.c - none of those use real dynamic allocation either,
// despite this dialect's `misc.h` genuinely providing `malloc`/`free`).
//
// A REAL UPSTREAM INCONSISTENCY, NORMALIZED (not preserved) - traced
// through rather than assumed: `checkBounces()` is the ONLY one of
// upstream's four loops over `survivors[]` (the others are
// `moveSurvivors()`, `drawSurvivors()`, and the "find a blank slot" loop
// in `spawnSurvivor()`) that omits a null-check before dereferencing
// `survivors[i]->_bounced` - a real, latent bug on actual AVR hardware
// (dereferencing a null `Survivor*` reads whatever raw memory happens to
// sit at that low address, since AVR has no MMU to fault on it). This
// port's own `FirebSurvivor[]` has no such foreign-memory case to
// replicate - every element is always a real, fully-initialized struct,
// never actual garbage - so `firebCheckBounces()` below adds the same
// `active` guard the other three loops already use, for consistency, not
// as a defensive "just in case" measure: traced through, an inactive
// slot's own fields always default to `step=0`/`bounced=false` (this
// dialect's own confirmed global/struct-array zero-init), and `step==0`
// never matches any of the three real bounce-trigger steps (3/9/15), so
// even an UNGUARDED version would behave identically here - the guard is
// added purely to match the other three loops' own style, with zero
// behavioral difference either way in this specific representation.
//
// PRESERVED REAL UPSTREAM BEHAVIOR (not bugs to fix - traced through and
// kept exactly as shipped):
// - `movePlayer()`'s own real LEFT/A and RIGHT/B checks are FOUR SEPARATE
//   `if` statements, not two OR'd conditions - so pressing both LEFT and A
//   (or RIGHT and B) on the exact same real tick moves the stretcher TWO
//   steps instead of one. A genuine, easily-reached upstream quirk (both
//   buttons are documented as equivalent "move left"/"move right" inputs
//   in the real README), reproduced literally in `firebMovePlayer()`
//   below rather than collapsed into an OR.
// - `spawnSurvivor()`'s own real `if (floorNo < 0) break;` check is
//   genuinely unreachable dead code: `floorNo` only ever decrements one
//   step at a time inside a `while` loop that itself breaks the instant
//   `floorNo` reaches 0 (before any further decrement), so it can never
//   go negative regardless of signedness. Ported as literal dead code
//   (`if (floorNo < 0) break;`) rather than removed, matching this
//   project's own "preserve real structure even when a branch is
//   provably inert" precedent (e.g. gameCastleDefence.c's own preserved
//   real bugs).
// - `loadHighscores()`'s own real per-iteration UNCONDITIONAL
//   `minHighscore = highscoreScores[j];` (not gated behind any
//   comparison) looks like a bug at first glance but is real, correct,
//   intentional code: since the table is always kept sorted descending by
//   `saveHighscore()`'s own bubble-up, the LAST loop iteration (index 4,
//   the lowest-ranked real entry) is exactly the "current minimum
//   highscore in the table" the rest of the game needs - both this real
//   game's own header comment ("Based on code from Crabator, by Rodot")
//   and gameUfoRace.c's own near-identical `initHighscore()` (crediting
//   the same real author/pattern) independently confirm this is a
//   deliberate, reused community idiom, not a mistake - ported literally
//   as the same unconditional per-iteration overwrite in
//   `firebLoadHighscores()` below.
//
// HIGHSCORE NAME ENTRY - DROPPED, DOCUMENTED (matching an exact existing
// precedent, not a new gap): upstream's own `gb.getDefaultName(tmp)` +
// `gb.keyboard(tmp, NAME_LETTERS+1)` (a real on-screen text-entry widget)
// has no equivalent anywhere in this shim - already found and documented
// identically by gameUfoRace.c/gameArmageddon.c/gameCastleDefence.c's own
// highscore tables. Per-name storage is dropped entirely rather than
// faked with a placeholder string: `firebHighscores[]` is a plain
// scores-only table, and `firebUpdateHighscores()` below shows only the 5
// real scores, right-aligned at upstream's own real screen position, with
// nothing invented in the name column upstream used to occupy (upstream's
// own real "-" placeholder for a zero-score name slot is dropped along
// with the rest of the name column, not kept as an orphaned dash).
//
// EEPROM - REAL PERSISTENCE, SIMPLIFIED LAYOUT (scores only, no names -
// see above). Upstream's own real `EEPROM.read()`/`EEPROM.write()` calls
// in `loadHighscores()`/`saveHighscore()` became this project's own
// `eeprom_read_word()`/`eeprom_write_word()` (2 bytes per score, address
// `i*2` for entry `i` - `eeprom_read_word()`/`_write_word()` already
// handle the real MSB/LSB byte packing internally, so this port needs no
// manual byte-splitting the way upstream's own raw `EEPROM.read()`/
// `.write()` byte-pair calls did). Upstream's own real
// `(highscoreScores[j]==0xFFFF) ? 0 : highscoreScores[j]` fresh-EEPROM
// sentinel check is preserved exactly (`eepromShim.c`'s own memory-card-
// backed cells default to 0xFF per byte too, matching real factory-erased
// AVR EEPROM - see eepromShim.h's own header comment).
//
// gb.battery.show=false, dropped outright (purely cosmetic on real
// hardware, matching every other port's own treatment). `survivorCount`
// (a real upstream global, incremented in `initGame()`/`spawnSurvivor()`
// but never read anywhere else in either real source file) is dropped
// entirely - genuinely dead, write-only data with zero observable effect,
// not a quirk worth preserving. `loadHighscores()` is called once from
// `gameFirebuino_init()` rather than deferred until after the first real
// title-screen dismissal the way real `setup()` sequences it
// (`titleScreen(); initGame(); loadHighscores();`) - a harmless
// reordering: no draw or comparison anywhere reads highscore data before
// the first real game-over, long after either ordering would have loaded
// it.
//
// BLOCKING LOOPS -> STATE MACHINE (matching this project's own established
// "blocking loop -> explicit resumable state" treatment - see gamePong.c's
// own header comment): `FIREB_STATE_TITLE`/`_MENU`/`_HIGHSCORES`/`_ABOUT`/
// `_PLAYING`/`_PAUSED`/`_GAMEOVER`. Real `gb.titleScreen(F("FireBuino!"),
// titleScreenBitmap)` became `firebUpdateTitle()`, dismissed by a genuine
// fresh `gbPressed(BTN_A)` exactly like gamePong.c/gameConduit.c's own
// title conversions - `firebInitGame()` runs on that same press, matching
// upstream's own real "titleScreen() blocks, THEN initGame() runs" order
// at every real call site (including the one real exception this
// normalizes away: upstream's own `gb.menu()` cancel/Button-B path shows
// titleScreen() WITHOUT a following initGame() call - since nothing can
// have changed game state between a still-fresh menu and cancelling out
// of it, always pairing the two here is provably behavior-identical).
// Real `gb.menu(menu, MENULENGTH)` became a hand-rolled `firebUpdateMenu()`
// (Up/Down navigate, A confirms, B cancels back to the title screen),
// matching gameConduit.c's/gameCrazyTown.c's own established replacement
// for this exact real widget. Real `drawHighScores()` - a blocking
// `while(true)` loop with TWO distinct real call sites (menuScreen()'s own
// "High scores" option, and saveHighscore()'s own tail after a genuine new
// high score) - became one shared `FIREB_STATE_HIGHSCORES` with a
// remembered `firebHighscoreReturnState` field, matching gameUfoRace.c's
// own identical `ufoHighscoreReturnState` precedent for exactly this
// shape of dual-purpose real screen.
//
// Text with an embedded real icon glyph (upstream's own `"\x17: Menu"`/
// `"\x15: Continue"`/`"\x17: Quit"`/`"\x17: Back"`) can't be written as a
// plain quoted string literal (ASCII 21/23 sit outside the printable
// range this dialect's string literals accept directly) - built as
// explicit `int[]` arrays instead, matching gameTaquin.c's/
// gameSimonbuino.c's own established precedent for the exact same real
// icon glyphs (21 = the real D-pad-arrow icon, 23 = the real reset/back
// icon - both already proven correct against this shim's real ported
// `gbFont3x5`/`gbFont5x7` tables by those two files).
//
// A second, genuine real use of `gbSetColorBg(color, bg)` (Parachute was
// the only real instance found by this project's own prior audit, per
// CLAUDE.md): `drawScore()`'s own real `gb.display.setColor(WHITE,
// BLACK)` for the large (`fontSize=2`) score digits in "new" mode is a
// real opaque WHITE-on-BLACK text draw (the score sits inside a solid
// black box baked into the background art), restored here via
// `gbSetColorBg(GB_WHITE, GB_BLACK)` rather than approximated - not a new
// shim gap, the primitive already existed.
//
// A REAL, PROJECT-WIDE SHIM BUG FOUND AND FIXED (not FireBuino-specific -
// this is a genuine `gamebuinoShim.c` bug, confirmed to also silently
// affect the already-shipped gamePong.c, not something this file's own
// code triggers uniquely): `gbDrawChar()`'s internal `gbDrawCharPixel()`
// helper computed a size-2 glyph's on-screen position as `(x+col)*2`
// instead of the real, correct `x + col*2` - identical only when the
// caller's own cursor position (`x`/`y`) is exactly 0. Every other cursor
// position gets doubled along with the glyph-local offset, silently
// shifting size-2 text and, once `x*2` alone exceeds `LCD_WIDTH`/
// `LCD_HEIGHT`, dropping it off-screen entirely (every pixel of the glyph
// fails `gbDrawPixel()`'s own bounds check). Found here because
// `firebDrawScore()`'s own real `cursorX` values (52-76, `fontSize=2`)
// landed the whole score digit off the 84px-wide screen - confirmed via a
// Puppeteer screenshot showing a fully blank score box where a white "0"
// should have been. Traced the same bug to gamePong.c's own real
// `gbFontSize=2` score display (`pongOpponentScore`, `cursorX=57`) by
// temporarily reverting the fix and capturing live gameplay: the
// opponent's score was completely absent and the player's own score
// (`cursorX=15`) rendered shifted into the middle of the playfield instead
// of its real top-left corner - a genuine, previously-unnoticed regression
// in an already-shipped game, not a hypothetical. Fixed directly in this
// port's own isolated `gamebuinoShim.c` copy: `gbDrawCharPixel()` now
// takes the cursor anchor (`x`,`y`) and the glyph-local (`col`,`row`)
// as four separate parameters instead of one pre-added `x+col` pair, and
// only the local offset is multiplied by `gbFontSize` internally
// (`x + col*size`) - `gbDrawChar()`'s own two call sites were updated to
// pass all four values instead of adding them together first. Verified
// with a full before/after Puppeteer comparison on both this game and
// gamePong.c. This fix is NOT yet in the real shared `gamebuinoShim.c` -
// see this port's own final report for the exact diff to merge.
//
// `subBackgroundBitmap`/`backgroundBitmap` are genuinely 88 pixels wide
// (`{88,48,...}`) on an 84-pixel-wide real LCD - a real 4px upstream
// overdraw, not a porting mistake: `gbDrawBitmap()` already clips every
// column past `LCD_WIDTH` per-pixel (see gamebuinoShim.c), so the extra 4
// columns are silently and safely discarded, matching whatever real
// hardware's own `Display::drawBitmap()` does with the same real
// out-of-range columns.
//
// No other shim gap was found - `gbDrawBitmap()`/`gbSetColorBg()`/
// `gbRepeat()`/`gbPrintNumber()`/real `gbFont3x5`/`eeprom_read_word()`/
// `eeprom_write_word()` all exist and are used directly as documented,
// with no local workaround needed for any of them.
