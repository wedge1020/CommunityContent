// CrazyTown (Clement83/Clement Quintard, http://quintard.me, license: none
// specified - github.com/Clement83/CrazyTown; taxi graphics credited
// upstream to "Quirby64"). A top-down taxi-driving game: steer a taxi
// (rotate + accelerate/brake, not a D-pad walker) around an open 128x128-
// tile world, pick up "clients" (French for "customers"/passengers - a
// single-player game, nothing networked) scattered around the map, and
// drive each one to a randomly-chosen destination before a countdown timer
// (selectable 3/5/10 real minutes) runs out. A compass needle on the HUD
// always points toward the current passenger's drop-off point (or toward
// nothing once no one is aboard). A 5-entry EEPROM-backed high-score table
// persists across sessions.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (this dialect has no classes/methods - see
// gamePong.c's own header comment for the general pattern).
// `random(N)`/`random(a,b)` became `arand(N)`/`a+arand(b-a)` (this
// dialect's own established RNG helper). `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became
// `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a documented no-op. `pow(x,2)` was simplified to
// `x*x` and `sqrt(pow(v,2))` to real `fabs(v)` (math.h provides `fabs`
// directly per this dialect's own documented math.h surface) - both
// mathematically identical to what upstream wrote, just without an
// unneeded `pow`/`sqrt` call. Upstream's own `Ufo` struct (x,y,v,vx,vy,
// angle,byte radius) ported as `struct TownPlayer` with `radius` widened
// to `int` (no `byte` alias exists in this project) - `radius` is a real,
// harmless piece of dead upstream data: assigned once in `initPlayer()`
// and never actually read anywhere else in the whole source (drawing uses
// the taxi bitmap's own fixed size, not the radius), kept only for
// structural fidelity.
//
// STATE MACHINE: upstream's own real control flow is entirely blocking
// calls - `setup()` shows a blocking `gb.titleScreen(logo)` once, then
// `loop()` repeatedly calls `drawMenu()`, itself a blocking `gb.menu(
// pauseMenu, 7)` (a real library-built-in list widget, not hand-drawn by
// this game's own source - see "THE PAUSE MENU IS A REASONABLE
// APPROXIMATION" below) dispatching via `switch` to `play()` (a blocking
// `while(1)` loop, exited by Button C or by the timer reaching 0),
// `drawMiniMap()` (a second blocking `while(1)` loop), or `drawHighScores()`
// (blocking until A/B/C) - with `default` (any unhandled `gb.menu()`
// result, including the real "Main Menu" entry, which upstream's own
// `switch` never gives its own explicit `case`) returning to the title
// screen. All of this was flattened into one explicit `TownState` enum
// (TITLE/MENU/PLAY/GAMEOVER/HIGHSCORES/MINIMAP) dispatched from
// `gameCrazyTown_update()`, matching the "blocking loop -> explicit
// resumable state" treatment used throughout this project (see
// gamePong.c's own header comment and gameUfoRace.c's own near-identical
// conversion). Button A dismisses the title screen (matching real
// `titleScreen()`'s own real dismiss button, and this engine's own
// menu-select button), Button C returns from PLAY to MENU (matching
// upstream's own real `play()` pause behavior) and from MENU to TITLE
// (matching upstream's own real menu-cancel/"Main Menu" `default` case),
// and A/B/C all dismiss HIGHSCORES and MINIMAP back to MENU (matching
// upstream's own real dismiss buttons in each case).
//
// THE PAUSE MENU IS A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION, NOT A PORT: `gb.menu(
// pauseMenu, PAUSEMENULENGTH)` is a real, generic, built-in list widget
// implemented *inside* the Gamebuino Classic library itself (like
// `gb.titleScreen()`) - its own real pixel-level rendering isn't present
// anywhere in this game's own source to port, only the seven real item
// strings it's called with ("Continue", "3 min play", "5 min play",
// "10 min play", "Map", "High scores", "Main Menu") and their real order,
// both kept exactly as upstream wrote them in `townUpdateMenu()` below.
// The actual on-screen layout (a compact UP/DOWN-navigated vertical list
// with a ">" cursor) is this port's own reasonable custom rendering of
// that real menu, the same treatment gameUfoRace.c's/gameFlappyBirdo.c's
// own library-internal-widget screens already established as this
// project's norm - font3x5 is forced explicitly here (this port's own
// deliberate choice so all 7 items fit the 48px-tall screen), unlike the
// PLAY/GAMEOVER/HUD screens below, which are genuine literal ports of real
// upstream drawing code and therefore preserve upstream's own real
// setFont() call sites (and lack thereof) exactly - see the per-function
// comments below for which is which.
//
// TITLE SCREEN: `gb.titleScreen(logo)` also draws a second, real built-in
// `gamebuinoLogo` boot-branding bitmap (confirmed directly in the real
// Gamebuino.cpp source) underneath every game's own custom logo - already
// an established, project-wide simplification to drop (gamePong.c and
// gameUfoRace.c's own title screens never reproduce it either, being
// purely cosmetic real-hardware branding), not a fresh oversight here.
// `townUpdateTitle()` below draws only CrazyTown's own real 64x36 `logo`
// bitmap at the real anchor `Gamebuino::titleScreen()` itself uses (y=12
// when no name string is passed, confirmed directly against the real
// source - lands the logo's own bottom row exactly on LCDHEIGHT=48) plus
// a "PRESS A" prompt, reusing gameUfoRace.c's own already-verified exact
// prompt position.
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED: Client1 (8x8, a passenger icon), GrandTaxi
// (24x9, the player's own taxi), the 64x36 title `logo`, and all 7 real
// 16x16 world tile sprites (Eau/Fleure/Foret/Pavillon/RoofTop/Usine/
// Usine2) were extracted byte-for-byte from upstream's own real
// `const byte NAME[] PROGMEM = {...}` arrays via a small script that
// parsed the real .ino source directly and cross-checked each array's own
// element count against its declared width/height (e.g. 34 ints per 16x16
// tile = 2 header + 32 body bytes; 2048 for the full 128x128 `world[]`
// bitmask = exactly WORLD_W*WORLD_H/8, confirmed fully populated with no
// partial-initializer zero-fill quirk this time, unlike gameUfoRace.c's
// own `world[]`) rather than hand-transcribed or guessed - into plain
// `int[N] name = { width, height, byte0, byte1, ... }` arrays below, the
// exact format `gbDrawBitmap()` expects. Checked the real "does upstream
// draw a separate fill/mask layer underneath this bitmap first"
// bleed-through bug class (found twice already in gameFlappyBirdo.c) for
// every one of these: it does NOT apply to any of them - Client1 and
// every world tile are complete, self-contained opaque tile textures drawn
// directly onto a screen `gbUpdate()` has just freshly cleared (matching
// gameUfoRace.c's own identical conclusion for its own tile sprites), and
// GrandTaxi is drawn one `gbDrawPixel()` at a time with no separate fill
// layer for the same reason to omit.
//
// GRANDTAXI NEEDS GENUINE CONTINUOUS-ANGLE ROTATION, NOT `gbDrawBitmapRotated()`:
// upstream's own `drawBitmapAngle()` (AffichageHelper.ino) is a completely
// custom per-pixel rotation helper - NOT a call into real `Display::
// drawBitmap(x,y,bitmap,rotation,flip)`'s own fixed 4-way NOROT/ROTCCW/
// ROT180/ROTCW rotation - it rotates the taxi sprite by the player's own
// real, continuous `float angle` (via `sin`/`cos`), something the real
// Display class itself never supported at all (upstream re-implements this
// from scratch by calling `gb.display.drawPixel()` directly per set bit,
// exactly like this port's own `townDrawBitmapAngle()` does). This is NOT
// a shim gap - there is no real-hardware primitive this could have called
// into instead, upstream wrote its own workaround too - so
// `townDrawBitmapAngle()` below is a direct, bit-for-bit port of that real
// per-pixel trig-rotation loop (`B10000000` -> `0x80`, `pgm_read_byte`
// reads replaced with direct `int[]` indexing per this shim's own
// established convention for baked bitmap data), not a new invention.
//
// TWO REAL SHIM PRIMITIVES THIS GAME RELIES ON (see also the final report
// to the user):
//
// 1. Real `Display::fillRoundRect()`/`drawRoundRect()` (used by
//    `drawHud()`'s own real "TAXI" status badge, a 21x7 box with a real
//    corner radius of 3) are ported directly as `gbFillRoundRect()`/
//    `gbDrawRoundRect()` in `gamebuinoShim.h`/`.c`, so both call sites here
//    simply call `gbFillRoundRect(27,0,21,7,3)`/`gbDrawRoundRect(27,0,21,7,3)`
//    directly, matching upstream's own real radius exactly.
// 2. Real `Display::setColor(INVERT)` (a genuine third draw mode, alongside
//    WHITE/BLACK, that XORs each drawn pixel against whatever is already on
//    screen) is ported directly as the `GB_INVERT` color constant in
//    `gamebuinoShim.h`/`.c` (every drawing primitive's color branch XORs the
//    target bit when `gbColor == GB_INVERT`). Upstream's own one real call
//    site (`drawHud()`, the "TAXI" badge label while a passenger is aboard)
//    does `setColor(BLACK); fillRoundRect(...); setColor(INVERT);` then
//    prints "TAXI" - ported here with `GB_INVERT` used directly at that same
//    call site, matching upstream's own call exactly.
//
// PLATFORM-REQUIRED DIV-BY-ZERO GUARDS (not upstream bugs, not behavior
// changes): `VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md` documents that division or modulo by
// zero (integer OR float) hard-traps this CPU, unlike real AVR hardware
// where a float division by zero silently yields Infinity/NaN. Two of
// upstream's own real formulas divide by a value that's virtually always
// nonzero in practice but isn't provably so: `upgradeScore()`'s own
// `distClient*100/distNext` (distNext is a real point-to-point distance,
// only exactly 0 if a client's freshly-randomized destination happens to
// land on the player's exact current float position) and `drawHud()`'s
// own `(AC/AB)` compass-needle scale (AB is the live distance to the
// current destination, which shrinks toward 0 as the player approaches
// it and could in principle hit exactly 0.0 on some frame before the
// drop-off threshold check fires). Both get a tiny explicit floor
// (`townDistNext`/`ab` bumped up to a small nonzero value) immediately
// before the division - functionally inert in every realistic play
// session, added purely so a real, if astronomically unlikely, exact
// coincidence can't hard-crash the whole game on this platform the way it
// never could have on real hardware.
//
// A REAL BUG, FOUND AND FIXED (not preserved): `updatePlayer()`'s own
// `distTotal += 8 * abs(player.v<0)` (and the identical `distClient +=
// 8 * abs(player.v<0)` right after it) compares `player.v` against 0 and
// takes `abs()` of the resulting 0/1 boolean, instead of the clearly-
// intended `abs(player.v)`. Since `player.v` (the taxi's own scalar speed)
// is only ever increased by a positive `+0.02` or scaled down by positive
// multipliers throughout this entire game - it is never actually assigned
// a negative value anywhere - `player.v<0` is always false, so this line
// always adds exactly 0: `distTotal`/`distClient` never accumulated any
// real distance at all. This wasn't just cosmetic (`distTotal` only feeds
// the "Dist:" game-over readout, which was therefore always "000000") -
// `distClient` also feeds directly into `upgradeScore()`'s own scoring
// formula (`diff = (distClient*100/distNext)-100`), so with `distClient`
// permanently stuck at 0, `diff` was always exactly -100, `max(2,diff)`
// always resolved to the floor value 2, and every single drop-off
// unconditionally awarded `distNext/2` points - upstream's own intended
// "efficiency bonus/penalty for how directly you drove" scoring mechanic
// never actually engaged. Flagged as a genuine negative player-experience
// bug and fixed, unlike this project's usual "preserve real upstream
// scoring behavior" norm for this class of bug (see gameAgaruino.c's own
// header comment on that norm) - `townUpdatePlayer()` now uses the
// clearly-intended `fabs(townPlayer.v)` directly.
//
// FRICTION ONLY APPLIES ON TILE 0 ("road") - NOT A BUG, JUST HOW UPSTREAM
// WROTE IT: `updatePlayer()`'s own real `switch(currentTile){ case 0: ...
// }` has no other case and no `default` at all - ported as a bare `if`
// with no `else`, meaning literally zero friction is ever applied while
// driving over any non-road tile (forest/water/building/etc - only a
// direct collision with an actual obstacle tile, id 1, ever slows the taxi
// down off-road). Noted explicitly so this doesn't look like a missed
// translation of additional upstream friction cases that were simply never
// there.
//
// `GetSpriteById()`'s real `switch` maps case 5 to `Usine2` and case 6 to
// `Usine` - the reverse of their own declaration order in `world.ino`
// (`Usine` is declared, then `Usine2`) - ported verbatim via
// `townSprites[]`'s own element order (index 5 = Usine2, index 6 = Usine)
// rather than "corrected", since it's real upstream's own asset-index
// mapping, not a porting slip. Unlike gameUfoRace.c's own `drawWorld()`,
// this game's real loop bounds (`y` checked against `WORLD_H`, `x` against
// `WORLD_W`) are NOT swapped - ported straightforwardly with no quirk to
// preserve, noted here only so its absence isn't mistaken for a missed
// translation.
//
// EEPROM / HIGH SCORES: upstream's own real per-entry EEPROM layout is 12
// bytes (10 real name-character bytes, written via a real on-screen
// `gb.getDefaultName()` + `gb.keyboard()` text-entry widget, plus a 2-byte
// LSB/MSB score) - `gb.keyboard()`/`gb.getDefaultName()` have no
// equivalent anywhere in this shim (no text-input widget exists at all;
// already an established, documented scope limit, not a fresh gap - see
// gameUfoRace.c's own identical "NAME ENTRY - DROPPED, DOCUMENTED"
// section). Per that same established precedent, name storage is dropped
// entirely rather than faked with a placeholder string: `townHighscore[]`
// is a plain 5-entry scores-only table, 2 bytes/entry (10 bytes total),
// read/written via manual `eeprom_read_byte()`/`eeprom_write_byte()` calls
// at address `i*2`/`i*2+1` preserving upstream's own real LSB-then-MSB
// byte order exactly (`eeprom_read_word()`/`eeprom_write_word()` were
// deliberately NOT used here - this shim's own versions split a 16-bit
// value MSB-then-LSB across `address`/`address+1`, the opposite order from
// upstream's own real LSB-then-MSB split, so using them would silently
// flip the byte order relative to what upstream actually wrote; manual
// per-byte calls in the exact real order sidestep the question entirely -
// matching gameUfoRace.c's own identical reasoning and identical simpler
// layout for the exact same reason). `townUpdateHighscores()` accordingly
// shows only the five real scores (matching upstream's own real
// `LCDWIDTH-4*fontWidth` right-aligned column formula and real header-text
// wobble effect) with no invented replacement text in the dropped name
// column, exactly like gameUfoRace.c's own precedent. Upstream's own
// `initHighscore()` has one harmless, fully inert line -
// `highscore[thisScore] = /*(highscore[thisScore]==9999) ? 0 : */
// highscore[thisScore];` - a self-assignment with the only real logic
// already commented out by upstream itself; it does nothing at all, so no
// translation of it exists below. `drawHighScores()`'s own real
// `gb.display.textWrap = false;` is dropped as a pure no-op here (already
// an established scope limit - `gbPrintString()` never wraps at all
// regardless of this flag, see gameSnakeAbc.c's own identical precedent).
// `gb.sound.playOK()`/`playCancel()`/`playTick()` ported 1:1 to
// `gbPlayOK()`/`gbPlayCancel()`/`gbPlayTick()`; the real multi-note
// `highscore_sound[]` PROGMEM pattern (`Sound::playPattern()`) that
// upstream never actually calls anywhere in this particular game's own
// source (it's declared in highscore.ino but dead - no real call site
// exists) needed no substitution at all.
//
// `gb.battery.show = false;` (real setup()-time cosmetic battery-icon
// suppression, `initGame()`'s own real call) was dropped outright, matching
// gamePong.c's/gameUfoRace.c's own identical treatment of the same
// real-hardware-only feature.
