// Super Crate Buino (Aurelien Rodot, license: none specified -
// github.com/Rodot/Super-Crate-Buino). A real action-platformer inspired by
// the PC game "Super Crate Box": one arena per map, a steady stream of
// enemies spawns from the top-center and chases the player, and the only
// way to score is to keep grabbing crates that fall from the sky - each
// crate re-rolls the player's current weapon at random (from whatever has
// been unlocked so far) and awards one point. Reaching per-map score
// thresholds unlocks new weapons and, eventually, the next of 5 real maps.
// Dying (touching an active enemy, or a real DISK bullet) resets score to
// zero and respawns on the same map.
//
// STRUCTURAL FLATTENING: real upstream is a small real C++ class hierarchy
// (`Box` as a base class with virtual `getWidth()`/`getHeight()`/
// `getGravity()`/`getMaxSpeed()`/`getXFriction()`/`getYFriction()`/
// `getXBounce()`/`getYBounce()`, and `Bullet`/`Player`/`Enemy`/`Crate` all
// inheriting it and overriding a subset) - this dialect has no classes or
// inheritance at all (see VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md), so every entity's real
// per-subtype "virtual getter" became a plain function taking whatever
// state it needs as parameters (`scbBulletGetWidth( subtype, vx, timeLeft )`
// etc), and the one real shared physics step (`Box::update()`) became
// `scbBoxUpdate()`, a single function taking every entity's current x/y/vx/
// vy/dir as OUT-parameters (the "everything by pointer" idiom
// VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md documents for any >1-word return) plus that
// entity's own already-computed gravity/friction/bounce/maxSpeed values -
// called identically by Bullet/Player/Enemy/Crate's own update functions
// below, exactly mirroring how each of their real C++ counterparts called
// the one real inherited `Box::update()`. `Bullet`/`Enemy` (both used as
// real arrays upstream) became `struct ScbBullet`/`struct ScbEnemy` arrays;
// `Player`/`Crate`/`World`/`Weapon` (each only ever a single real instance)
// became plain flat globals. `Weapon.shooter` is always the single real
// player instance in upstream (set once in `Player::init()` and never
// reassigned), so every `shooter->x`/`shooter->getWidth()` call below reads
// the player's own globals directly instead of carrying a "shooter"
// reference of any kind - a simplification that loses nothing, matching
// this project's own established "flatten a real single-instance
// relationship" precedent.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site is mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment - this
// dialect has no classes/methods). `random(N)`/`random(a,b)` became
// `arand(N)`/`scbArduinoRandom(a,b)` (the latter a direct, deliberate port
// of real Arduino core's own `random(long,long)` - see its own comment
// below for why this exact port, not a naive `a+arand(b-a)` rewrite,
// matters for two real, verified upstream quirks). `byte`/`char` became
// plain `int` throughout (no genuinely-boolean `byte` usage here the way
// gameAgaruino.c had). Every real `switch` statement became an if/else-if
// chain (this dialect's own `switch` support remains unproven - matching
// the same caution gamePong.c/gameTaquin.c/gameUfoRace.c already
// established), which also made every real (and there are several - see
// below) upstream fallthrough behavior something that had to be traced
// through by hand and reproduced explicitly rather than something the
// if/else-if rewrite could get by accident.
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED VERBATIM: every one of upstream's real
// `PROGMEM` byte tables (the title `logo`, the 5 real tile-bitmaps-encoded-
// as-bitmaps world maps, all 7 real ground/platform/wall tile textures used
// across them, all 13 real weapon sprites plus their 5 real white-highlight
// overlays, the 5-frame player sprite, the 5-frame small-enemy sprite, the
// 6-frame big-enemy sprite, and the crate sprite) was copied byte-for-byte
// into plain `int[]` arrays below - hex literals copied directly, and the
// 5 real world maps (upstream's own `B########`-style binary literals, one
// per byte) converted to the equivalent hex value one-for-one via a small
// verification script (counting each map's own real declared width/height
// against its own real total element count, catching any transcription
// mistake immediately rather than trusting it by eye - every one of the 5
// matched its own expected count exactly). `largeChecker` (a real declared
// `PROGMEM` tile bitmap) and `revolver_sound`/`player_damage_sound` (two
// real declared `PROGMEM` sound patterns) are never referenced anywhere
// else in the real upstream source - confirmed via a direct grep, not
// assumed - so all three are genuinely dead upstream constants, correctly
// omitted here rather than ported as unused data.
//
// MAPS ARE REAL BITMAPS, REUSED DIRECTLY AS BITMAPS: upstream's own real
// `World::tileAtPosition()`/`World::draw()` call `gb.display.
// getBitmapPixel(tiles, x, y)` directly on the very same `map0..map4[]`
// byte arrays also passed to `gb.display.drawBitmap()` for the map-select
// preview - a real, deliberate upstream dual-use of one data format (this
// shim's own `gbGetBitmapPixel()`/`gbDrawBitmap()` share the exact same
// `[width,height,then packed rows]` layout real `Display::getBitmapPixel()`/
// `drawBitmap()` do), so `scbMap0..scbMap4[]` below are genuine drop-in
// replacements needing no reinterpretation, and `scbTileAtPosition()`/
// `scbWorldDraw()` call `gbGetBitmapPixel()` on them exactly like upstream.
//
// EEPROM: upstream's own real `loadEEPROM()`/`saveEEPROM()`/
// `EEPROMreadInt()`/`EEPROMwriteInt()`/`cleanEEPROM()` (a real 2-byte
// token + per-map best-score table + unlocked-weapons/unlocked-maps bytes,
// with a real "only write if the stored value is stale" guard to limit
// wear) port directly onto this shim's own `eeprom_read_byte()`/
// `eeprom_write_byte()` (real address range 0-1023, matching
// `cleanEEPROM()`'s own real 1024-byte wipe loop) - see `scbLoadEeprom()`/
// `scbSaveEeprom()` below, called from this game's own `init()` and from
// every real call site upstream calls them from (every scoring death, the
// pause-menu's own "B: SAVE & QUIT", and once per real gameplay tick from
// the main PLAY state, exactly matching upstream's own `saveEEPROM()`
// call inside `loop()`'s own `if (gb.update())` block).
//
// A REAL CROSS-GAME-LAUNCH RESET THIS PORT NEEDS THAT UPSTREAM NEVER DID:
// this game's own local popup state (`scbPopupTimeLeft`/`scbPopupText` -
// see "POPUP" below for why it is local rather than the shared shim's own
// `gbPopup()`) is explicitly zeroed in `gameSuperCrateBuino_init()`, along
// with `scbShakeTimeLeft`. Real hardware only ever runs one sketch per
// power-on, so upstream never needed this; this cartridge can relaunch the
// same game many times in one session, and without this reset a stale
// nonzero popup timer left over from a previous play session (e.g. a
// "GAME OVER!" message that was still mid-slide-out when the player backed
// out to the top-level menu) would incorrectly resume animating on the
// next launch - the same class of fix `gbFrameCount`/the shared shim's own
// `gbPopupTimeLeft` already needed, documented in this project's own
// CLAUDE.md, just applied here to a second, game-local popup timer that
// mechanism doesn't cover.
//
// POPUP - A LOCAL REIMPLEMENTATION, NOT THE SHARED `gbPopup()`: matching
// `gameMinesweeper.c`'s/`game2048.c`'s own established precedent for
// deliberately NOT migrating to the shared shim primitive when a game has
// a genuine, specific extra requirement it doesn't cover - here, real
// `Player::kill()` explicitly force-cancels whatever popup is currently
// showing (`popupTimeLeft = 0;`) before deciding whether to show a fresh
// "NEW HIGHSCORE!" one, and the shared `gbPopup()`'s own internal timer
// isn't exposed for a game to reset directly. `scbPopup()`/
// `scbUpdatePopup()` below are instead a direct, hand-ported copy of real
// upstream's own `popup()`/`updatePopup()` (the same real slide-in-from-
// the-bottom, auto-dismissing bordered box, built from the same
// `gbDrawRect()`/`gbFillRect()`/`gbPrintString()` primitives), giving this
// game the real force-cancel capability upstream's own upstream code
// relies on.
//
// SOUND - REAL PATTERNS, PLAYED FOR REAL: every real upstream
// `gb.sound.playPattern(name_sound, channel)` call (13 real distinct
// weapon-fire/explosion/enemy/jump/pickup effects) now plays for real via
// `gbPlayPattern()` - the real tracker/pattern engine gamebuinoShim.c/.h
// implements (see that file's own Sound section header comment) - using
// the real, byte-for-byte pattern data (`scbBlastSound[]`/
// `scbRocketSound[]`/`scbMachinegunSound[]`/`scbGrenadeSound[]`/
// `scbShotgunSound[]`/`scbLaserSound[]`/`scbClubSound[]`/`scbJumpSound[]`/
// `scbEnemyFeltSound[]`/`scbEnemyDeathSound[]`/`scbPowerUpSound[]`, see the
// "Sound patterns" section below), each played on the exact real channel
// upstream's own call site uses (0 for every weapon-fire/blast effect, 1
// for jump/enemy-death, 2 for enemy-felt/two of the three `power_up_sound`
// sites - real upstream's own `Weapon::shoot()`/`Bullet::update()`/
// `Player::update()`/`Enemy::update()`/`Crate::update()` call sites were
// each individually traced to confirm both the pattern name and channel
// number). No `changeInstrumentSet()`/`command(CMD_INSTRUMENT,...)` call
// precedes any of them upstream either, so the engine's own real default
// square-wave instrument on every channel is already correct.
// `playTick()`/`playOK()` (PISTOL/AKIMBO/RIFLE fire, and picking up a
// crate) were already real one-shot calls, unchanged.
// `player_damage_sound[]`/`revolver_sound[]` (2 of the 13 real declared
// constants) are genuinely never referenced anywhere in real upstream
// source (confirmed via grep), so, matching this file's own already-
// established treatment of `largeChecker`, they're correctly omitted here
// too - only the 11 real, actually-called patterns are ported.
// `gb.sound.chanVolumes[2] = 1;` (upstream's own setup()-time comment:
// "this game requires 3 channels...") is dropped outright, matching the
// engine's own deliberate, documented design (see gamebuinoShim.c's own
// comment on `gbUpdateNoteChannel()`): real hardware's `chanVolumes`/
// `globalVolume` exist purely to keep several real channels summed into
// ONE shared physical PWM output from clipping, which doesn't apply here
// (each Vircon32 SPU channel mixes independently in hardware). Worth
// noting: on real hardware this specific call is also provably a no-op -
// `VOLUME_CHANNEL_MAX` (real `Sound.cpp`'s own real per-channel default,
// `255/NUM_CHANNELS/7/9`) evaluates to exactly `1` for any of upstream's
// own commented "requires 3 channels" value, this project's real
// `MAX_SOUND_CHANNELS` of 4, or the real library's own default of 1 - so
// `chanVolumes[2]` already defaults to the same `1` this line explicitly
// (and redundantly) sets it to on real hardware too. `gb.pickRandomSeed()`/
// `gb.battery.show = false;` are dropped, matching gamePong.c's own
// identical treatment of both.
//
// SEVERAL REAL UPSTREAM BUGS/QUIRKS, TRACED THROUGH (NOT ASSUMED) AND
// PRESERVED EXACTLY, PER THIS PROJECT'S OWN ESTABLISHED NORM:
//
// 1) `Box::update()`'s own real Y-axis collision-resolution block is gated
//    on `if (getXBounce() >= 0)` - the SAME condition guarding the X-axis
//    block above it, not `getYBounce() >= 0` (confirmed directly against
//    the real source, not assumed a typo away). Traced through for every
//    entity that ever returns a negative `getXBounce()` (dead Player,
//    Bullet subtypes CLUB/EXPLOSION/LASER, dead Enemy): every one of them
//    ends up with ZERO real Y-axis world collision at all while that
//    condition holds, letting a dead player's/dead enemy's ragdoll (and a
//    club swing's/explosion's/laser bolt's own bullet hitbox) fall or fly
//    straight through floors and walls - a real, visible, load-bearing
//    gameplay effect (the death "fling" clipping through the map), not an
//    inert corner case, so `scbBoxUpdate()` below gates both its X and Y
//    resolution blocks on the same `xBounce` parameter, exactly like real
//    `Box::update()` does.
//
// 2) `Weapon::addBullet()`'s own real screen-shake `switch` has a genuine
//    fallthrough: `case W_SNIPER: case W_REVOLVER: shakeTimeLeft=4;
//    shakeAmplitude=4; case W_MACHINEGUN: shakeTimeLeft=2;
//    shakeAmplitude=1;` - SNIPER/REVOLVER's own distinct heavier shake
//    value is set, then immediately overwritten by falling into
//    MACHINEGUN's own weaker one (no `break`). Net real effect: all three
//    weapons produce the exact same (weaker) shake. `scbWeaponAddBullet()`
//    below reproduces this by setting the MACHINEGUN values directly for
//    all three subtypes, rather than the SNIPER/REVOLVER values the
//    upstream `case` labels suggest were intended.
//
// 3) The same function's own real initial-bullet-speed `switch` has a
//    second fallthrough: `case W_MACHINEGUN: vx=...; vy=random(-16,17);
//    shooter->vx -= shooter->dir*32; case W_SHOTGUN: vx=...;
//    vy=random(-10,11); break;` - MACHINEGUN's own distinct vy spread
//    (-16..17) is computed (and the real player-recoil side effect fires,
//    using the pre-fallthrough `shooter->dir`), then immediately discarded
//    by falling into SHOTGUN's own fresh recompute. Net real effect:
//    MACHINEGUN bullets get the exact same vx/vy DISTRIBUTION as SHOTGUN
//    bullets (just an independent random draw), while still applying the
//    real recoil kick SHOTGUN itself never gets. Reproduced exactly below.
//
// 4) The same function's own real horizontal-offset `switch` has a THIRD
//    fallthrough: `case W_SHELL: x-=16; case W_ROCKET: case W_CLUB:
//    x-=dir*32; case W_MINE: break; default: x+=dir*46;` - SHELL genuinely
//    gets BOTH its own `-16` offset AND the ROCKET/CLUB `-dir*32` offset
//    applied on top of it (not a bug exactly, but a real cascade worth
//    calling out) - reproduced exactly (`x -= 16; x -= dir*32;` for SHELL
//    specifically, both applied).
//
// 5) Real `Bullet::getDamage()`'s own `switch (subtype) { return 1; case
//    W_REVOLVER: ... }` has a leading `return 1;` statement with no `case`
//    label of its own, positioned before the first real case label - under
//    real C/C++ switch semantics this is unreachable dead code (a `switch`
//    jumps straight to whichever label matches; nothing ever "falls into"
//    the very top of the body unless a label sits there) - the function's
//    real reachable behavior is exactly its own explicit `case`s plus its
//    own `default: return 1;` at the bottom. `scbBulletGetDamage()` below
//    implements only the real reachable logic.
//
// 6) Real Arduino core's own `random(long howsmall, long howbig)`
//    (`WMath.cpp`) has a real, defined short-circuit: if `howsmall >=
//    howbig`, it returns `howsmall` UNMODIFIED, with no random draw at
//    all. `scbArduinoRandom()` below is a direct, deliberate port of that
//    exact function (not a naive `min + arand(max-min)` rewrite) because
//    two real upstream call sites depend on this short-circuit for their
//    own real, verified behavior, not just a hypothetical edge case:
//      - `EnemiesEngine::update()`'s own real `enemies[i].vy =
//        random(-48, -64);` (arguments reversed from the "obviously
//        intended" `random(-64,-48)`, presumably a real upstream typo) -
//        under the real short-circuit this ALWAYS evaluates to exactly
//        `-48`, not a randomized upward launch speed at all. A killed
//        enemy's own vertical launch velocity is therefore a real
//        constant on real hardware too, not a range - preserved exactly.
//      - `Crate::update()`'s own real weapon-reroll `random(1,
//        unlockedWeapons+1)`: while `unlockedWeapons==0` (true for every
//        map before its own first weapon unlock), `howsmall(1) >=
//        howbig(1)` holds, so this also always evaluates to the constant
//        `1` - though this particular case is provably inert either way,
//        since the surrounding `% (unlockedWeapons+1)` is `% 1`, which is
//        always `0` regardless of the random draw's own value.
//
// 7) Because of bug/quirk 6 immediately above, real upstream's own weapon-
//    name-popup `switch (player.weapon.subtype)` (in `Crate::update()`)
//    has no `case W_PISTOL:` at all - and since the reroll can only ever
//    actually land on subtype 0 (PISTOL) while `unlockedWeapons==0`
//    (every subsequent reroll's own real range is `[1,unlockedWeapons]`,
//    never touching 0 again), this is exactly the one subtype the reroll
//    can produce that has no matching popup case. Net real effect: the
//    very first crate pickup on a fresh map0 (before anything is unlocked)
//    silently shows NO weapon-name popup at all (score still increments,
//    the popup logic below just has nothing to show) - preserved exactly,
//    no `case`/`else if` added for PISTOL in `scbCrateUpdate()` below.
//
// 8) `loop()`'s own real camera-follow gating literally reads
//    `world.getWidth()*SCALE <= LCDWIDTH` / `...getHeight()*SCALE <=
//    LCDHEIGHT` - `getWidth()`/`getHeight()` already have one real `SCALE`
//    factor baked in (`SPRITE_SIZE*tiles_wide*SCALE`), so multiplying by
//    `SCALE` again yields a number in the tens of thousands for every one
//    of the 5 real shipped maps, meaning this condition is realistically
//    always false (a likely real upstream typo - probably meant `/SCALE`)
//    - but verified provably inert for all 5 real maps either way (even
//    the "corrected" divide-based version stays false for every one of
//    them too, since even the smallest map's own screen-space width/height
//    already exceeds LCDWIDTH/LCDHEIGHT), so ported literally
//    (`scbWorldGetWidth() * SCB_SCALE <= LCDWIDTH`) rather than "fixed".
//
// 9) `World::draw()`'s own real edge/corner-tile detection runs two
//    independent, non-exclusive `if` checks (right-neighbor-empty sets
//    `flip=FLIPH; offset=2`; left-neighbor-empty sets `bitmap=edge` again
//    but does NOT reset `flip`/`offset`) - for the (real, if rare) case of
//    an isolated single-tile-wide platform where BOTH neighbors are empty,
//    the tile is drawn using the FIRST check's own flip/offset regardless.
//    Ported as the same two sequential, non-exclusive `if`s (no `else`,
//    no reset) in `scbWorldDraw()` below.
//
// 10) `loop()`'s own real camera-smoothing code (a 3-line `cameraX =
//     (3*cameraX+x)/4` EMA blend) is entirely commented out in upstream's
//     own shipped source (`//int x = ...; //cameraX = ...`) - real
//     shipped behavior is an instant, unsmoothed camera snap every tick
//     (the two lines immediately below it, which are NOT commented out).
//     Not ported here either, matching the real shipped behavior exactly
//     (this is not a simplification on this port's part - the dead code
//     was already dead in the real, distributed upstream source).
//
// DROPPED WITH NO OBSERVABLE EFFECT: `World::draw()`'s own real `byte
// tileNumber = 1; //platform by default` is assigned once and never read
// again anywhere in that function - genuinely dead, dropped here too.
