// SnakeAbcBuino (frthery, license: None specified -
// github.com/frthery/SnakeAbcBuino). A Snake variant with an educational
// twist: instead of generic food pellets, the snake collects letters of the
// alphabet in strict order (A, B, C, ... Z, then wrapping back to A), each
// pickup growing the snake by one segment and speeding the game up a
// little; 9 selectable starting speed levels via an in-game level-select
// menu (Button C, mid-play); running into a wall or your own body ends the
// round.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why -
// this dialect has no classes/methods). Every upstream global/function got
// an `sabc`-prefixed name, since Vircon32 has no linker and every game in
// this single compiled cartridge shares one flat global namespace -
// especially important here since a second, separate Snake port
// (snake-gamebuino-classic, prefix `snkc`) already exists in this same
// cartridge (see gameSnakeClassic.c's own header comment, which already
// calls out this exact game by name for that reason). Upstream's own
// `boolean`/`short`/`byte`/`unsigned long` all became plain `int`/`bool`
// (this dialect's own real primitives).
//
// Several real adaptations were needed beyond the usual mechanical rewrite:
//
// 1. **Title screen.** Upstream's own blocking `gb.titleScreen(logo)` was
//    converted into an explicit SABC_STATE_TITLE state, matching gamePong.c's
//    own titleScreen-to-state-machine treatment. The real 64x36 `logo[]`
//    bitmap itself is drawn as sabcTitleBitmap via this project's own
//    gbDrawBitmap() primitive (see that array's own comment for the
//    B-binary-literal conversion this needed).
//
// 2. **The level-select menu's own long/unsupported text.** Upstream's own
//    `GameMenu()` (reached by pressing C mid-play, matching real
//    `Buttons::pressed(BTN_C)`) drew two `gb.display.fillTriangle(...)`
//    up/down arrows - ported directly at their real upstream coordinates
//    via the real `gbFillTriangle()` shim primitive (see
//    `sabcUpdateMenu()`). Its own title line
//    ("-CHOOSE GAME LEVEL-", 20 characters) and its accept/cancel hint
//    (`"\x15:accept \x16:cancel"`, using non-printable custom Gamebuino
//    icon glyphs plus a colon, neither supported by this shim's font - see
//    gamebuinoShim.h's own supported-character list) were both shortened/
//    replaced: "PICK LEVEL" (fits the 84px width at font size 1) and
//    "A=YES B=NO" (spells out the same two real buttons in plain
//    supported characters), matching this project's own established
//    "shorten/adapt unsupported upstream text" precedent (see
//    gameAgaruino.c's/gameTaquin.c's own header comments for other worked
//    examples). Converted into an explicit SABC_STATE_MENU state (upstream
//    itself already modeled this as a plain re-entrant `game_menu` flag
//    checked at the top of loop(), not a blocking call - ported the same
//    way here for consistency with every other state in this file).
//    Upstream's own third menu option (Button C = `gb.changeGame()`, a
//    real-hardware "switch to a different game on the SD card" OS
//    feature) has no equivalent in this single-cartridge menu model and
//    was dropped outright - Button C simply does nothing while this menu
//    is open here.
//
// 3. **The Game Over screen's own letter listing.** Upstream builds and
//    prints a `String` of every letter collected so far, using
//    `gb.display.textWrap = true` to wrap it across as many lines as
//    needed - this shim's `gbPrintString()` has no wrapping at all, and
//    the 48px-tall screen has no room left for a multi-line list anyway
//    once the "GAME OVER" title, score, and level are also shown. Replaced
//    with a plain "LETTERS <count>" line instead - genuinely equivalent
//    information, not a loss: this game always collects letters starting
//    from 'A' in strict fixed order every single playthrough
//    (`sabcLetterIndex`/`sabcLetterMaxIndex` both reset to 0 in
//    `sabcResetGame()`), so a bare count fully determines which letters
//    were shown (always "A" through the Nth letter) without needing to
//    actually list them. Upstream's own secondary derived stat
//    (`score * level`, a display-only bonus multiply) was dropped too, to
//    fit the remaining vertical space - a cosmetic-only trim, since both
//    of its own inputs (score, level) are still shown separately.
//
// 4. **Sound.** Upstream's own `PlaySoundFx()` used `gb.sound.command(...)`
//    to set a per-note waveform/volume-slide/pitch-slide "FX Synth" preset
//    (credited upstream to yodasvideoarcade.com) before calling
//    `gb.sound.playNote(pitch, duration, channel)` - ported call-for-call
//    via this shim's real `gbSoundCommand()`/`gbPlayNoteChannel()` tracker/
//    pattern primitives as `sabcPlaySoundFx()`, matching
//    gameSimonbuino.c's/gameBlocksBuino.c's own identical treatment of the
//    same "FX Synth"-shaped preset table, always channel 0 (matching every
//    real call site here, both of which pass `SND_FX_CHANNEL_1` = 0).
//    `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became `gbPickRandomSeed()` (a documented
//    no-op), and `gb.battery.show = false;` was dropped outright, matching
//    every other port's own treatment of these two calls.
//
// 5. **The collectible letter itself.** Upstream already draws it as plain
//    text (`gb.display.print(letters[letter_index])`, a single character -
//    no custom bitmap involved at all), so this ports directly as a
//    one-character `gbPrintString()` call (`sabcPrintChar()` below). Since
//    upstream's own `letters[]` table is just 'A'..'Z' in strict
//    consecutive order, this port computes the ASCII code directly as
//    `65 + sabcLetterIndex` instead of keeping a redundant 26-entry lookup
//    table.
//
// 6. **Dead code dropped.** `ShowFrame()`/`ShowDebug()` are defined
//    upstream but never actually called from `setup()`/`loop()` or
//    anywhere else in the real source (confirmed by reading the entire
//    459-line file before dropping them) - left out entirely, matching
//    gameSimonbuino.c's own precedent for dropping confirmed-inert
//    upstream code. Upstream never calls any `EEPROM.*` function anywhere
//    (no high-score persistence exists in the real game), so none was
//    added here either, per this project's own "don't invent gameplay
//    behavior not in the upstream source" rule.
//
// 7. **Timing.** Upstream gates each grid-step move on real wall-clock
//    time (`millis()` compared against a per-level `game_delai`
//    millisecond threshold, from the verbatim-copied `game_levels[]`
//    table) rather than on `gb.update()`'s own frame throttle - this port
//    keeps the exact same millisecond thresholds, but compares them
//    against a simple per-tick accumulator (`sabcMoveTimer`, incremented
//    by 50ms - this shim's own fixed default logic-tick duration at its
//    unchanged 20fps rate, matching upstream's own commented-out
//    `gb.setFrameRate(game_frame_rate)` call, i.e. the two were always
//    going to run at the same real tick rate anyway) instead of a genuine
//    `millis()` readout, since Vircon32 has no wall-clock primitive to
//    read here.
//
// Multiple real upstream quirks found while reading the source closely,
// preserved deliberately rather than "fixed":
// - **Letter pickup is detected one full move-step late.** Upstream's own
//   `CheckLetterCollision()` (called from inside `MoveSnake()`, right
//   after that step's new head position is computed) reads the collision
//   rectangle straight from the global `snake[0][]` - which at that exact
//   point in the code has *not yet* been updated with this step's new head
//   position (the body-shift loop that does that runs afterward). So the
//   check actually compares the position the head is *currently sitting
//   at* (as drawn on the previous move-step) against the letter, not the
//   position it's moving into. Net effect: the snake has to already be
//   sitting visibly on top of the letter for one full move-interval before
//   the pickup actually registers and the letter respawns. Preserved
//   exactly below (`sabcCheckLetterCollision()` is likewise called with
//   `sabcSnakeX[0]`/`sabcSnakeY[0]`, before that tick's body-shift loop
//   runs), since this is a real, visible piece of the original game's own
//   feel, not a porting mistake.
// - **The letter's position (and any in-progress "needs a new spot"
//   search) is never reset across a Game Over -> restart.** Upstream's own
//   `InitGame()` resets the snake's position/size/direction, the score,
//   and the letter *index*, but never touches `letter_x`/`letter_y`/
//   `new_letter` - so a freshly-restarted game keeps showing the letter
//   wherever the previous game happened to leave it, exactly like real
//   hardware. `sabcResetGame()` below matches this precisely (only
//   `sabcLetterX`/`sabcLetterY`/`sabcNewLetter`'s *initial* cold-boot
//   values are set, once, in `gameSnakeAbc_init()`).
// - **A cancelled level-menu edit is sticky.** Pressing B in the level
//   menu discards the edited level *without* resetting the menu's own
//   displayed value back to the active level - it keeps showing whatever
//   was last dialed in until the next real game reset re-syncs it
//   (`sabcResetGame()` always sets `sabcMenuLevel = sabcGameLevel`).
//   Matches upstream's own identical `game_menu_level` behavior exactly.
//
// One small, deliberate divergence (not a preserved quirk): upstream's own
// move-timer (`game_prevTime`, a raw `millis()` snapshot) and
// `snake_has_moved` flag are both, like the letter position above, never
// explicitly reset across a restart - but unlike the letter position, that
// carryover has no clean equivalent for this port's own tick-accumulator
// timer (there's no stale "millis() snapshot" concept to carry over), so
// `sabcMoveTimer`/`sabcSnakeHasMoved` are both reset to a clean state in
// `sabcResetGame()` instead. The practical difference is negligible (at
// most, whether the very first directional input after a restart is
// accepted immediately or one move-interval later).
//
// Upstream's own `snake[100][2]` position array (a 2D array - proven to
// work fine in this dialect, see gameSimonbuino.c's own `simonSoundFx`
// table) was still split into two parallel `int[100]` arrays
// (`sabcSnakeX`/`sabcSnakeY`) below purely as a style choice for
// readability, not a syntax workaround. Upstream's own snake length is
// technically unbounded (it keeps growing forever, one letter at a time,
// indefinitely re-cycling A-Z) against a fixed 100-slot array - a genuine
// latent out-of-bounds write on real hardware too if a session ever ran
// long enough (~97 pickups), but one this port defensively clamps
// (`sabcSnakeSize` stops growing at `SABC_SNAKE_MAX_SIZE - 1`) rather than
// risk corrupting a *different* game's own global state the way an actual
// out-of-bounds write could in this shared, linker-less single binary -
// matching gameSimonbuino.c's own precedent of avoiding a real OOB write
// even where upstream's own version of it was harmless.
