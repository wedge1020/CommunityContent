// Skibuino (Mike Del Pozzo, GPLv3 - real LICENSE file confirmed -
// github.com/delpozzo/skibuino). A skiing game: ski continuously downhill
// through a scrolling 192x256 map, steering left/right around trees and
// logs, with a temporary jump (clears logs, not trees) and a power-slide
// speed boost; distance skied ("meters traveled") is the score, and the
// farthest run ever survived is saved as a high score across sessions.
// Hitting an obstacle (without jumping over a log) ends the run with a
// random one-line death quip and a short game-over animation before
// restarting. A genuinely novel genre for this cartridge - no other ported
// game here is a skiing/downhill-runner game.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why -
// this dialect has no classes/methods). Every global/function got a
// `ski`-prefixed name (this single compiled cartridge shares one flat
// global namespace across every game - confirmed unused by grepping the
// whole `src/` tree before picking it). `random(N)` became `arand(N)`;
// upstream's own two-argument `random(LCDHEIGHT, MAPHEIGHT-LCDHEIGHT-16)`
// (used for every obstacle's own spawn Y) became `LCDHEIGHT + arand(
// (MAPHEIGHT-LCDHEIGHT-16) - LCDHEIGHT)` (this dialect's own established
// `min + arand(max-min)` ranged-random idiom), factored into one
// `skiRandObstacleY()` helper since all three obstacle spawners
// (trees/logs) use the exact same real range. `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became
// `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a documented no-op (this project's own established
// precedent for every upstream `randomSeed()`-style call).
//
// STATE MACHINE: upstream has TWO real blocking calls converted here, both
// via this project's own established "blocking loop -> explicit resumable
// state" treatment (see gamePong.c's own header comment for the pattern):
//   - `setup()`'s own blocking `gb.titleScreen(gameLogo)` (shown once at
//     boot) became `SKI_STATE_TITLE`/`skiUpdateTitle()`, dismissed by a
//     genuine `gbPressed(BTN_A)` exactly like every other ported title
//     screen here.
//   - `pauseGame()`'s own blocking `while(1) { if(gb.update()) {...} }`
//     loop (entered from inside `playerThink()` on a Button-C press)
//     became `SKI_STATE_PAUSE`/`skiUpdatePause()`, with upstream's own
//     internal `highScoreResetFlag` boolean preserved verbatim as
//     `skiHighScoreResetFlag` to pick between its two real sub-screens
//     (the main P A U S E D menu, and the "...are you sure?" high-score-
//     reset confirmation) - both ported as direct, near-verbatim
//     transcriptions of upstream's own real text/layout/button checks.
//     ONE DELIBERATE, DOCUMENTED SIMPLIFICATION: real `pauseGame()` is
//     called *from the middle of* `playerThink()` and, being a genuinely
//     blocking call, execution resumes at the very next line once it
//     returns - so on real hardware, pressing C mid-tick still finishes
//     that same tick's own jump-countdown/x-clamp/scroll-refresh/
//     `metersTraveled+=yspeed` tail logic (using pre-pause state) the
//     instant the player resumes. A non-blocking state machine can't
//     preserve that without unnaturally restructuring `playerThink()`
//     itself into two halves - so, matching every other blocking-call
//     conversion in this project, `skiPlayerThink()` instead just
//     `return`s immediately after entering `SKI_STATE_PAUSE`, skipping
//     that one tick's tail logic outright (it resumes fresh, from the top
//     of `skiPlayerThink()`, on the tick play actually resumes). `skiMeters
//     Traveled` under-counts by at most one `yspeed` per pause - imperceptible
//     over a run that's normally hundreds of meters long. `skiUpdatePlay()`
//     itself also checks `skiState` right after calling `skiThinkAll()` and
//     skips `skiUpdateCamera()`/`skiDrawAll()` for that tick if a pause was
//     just entered mid-think - avoiding a half-finished gameplay frame
//     being rendered underneath the very first pause-menu tick.
//   - Real `pauseGame()`'s own "A: Title Screen" option calls the real
//     blocking `setup()` again in full (re-running `gb.titleScreen()` from
//     scratch) - ported as transitioning back to `SKI_STATE_TITLE`
//     (`skiClearEntities(); skiBeginTitle();`), which - via the exact same
//     title-dismiss handler used at boot - re-runs `skiInitEntities()`/
//     `skiInitCamera()`/`skiStartGame()` once Button A is pressed again,
//     the same real call sequence `setup()` performs. Real upstream's own
//     `setup()`/`startGame()` never call `saveHighScore()` on this path
//     (only `restartGame()` - reached exclusively via a real crash/game-
//     over, or the high-score-reset confirm - ever does), so quitting to
//     the title screen from the pause menu mid-run would silently discard a
//     genuinely-higher-than-recorded `metersTraveled` without ever writing
//     it to EEPROM. FIXED HERE, NOT PRESERVED: the same highscore check
//     `skiRestartGame()` already performs now also runs on this "A: Title
//     Screen" path, in `skiUpdatePause()`, before the run's own state is
//     cleared.
//
// ENTITY SYSTEM: upstream's own generic `Entity` struct/array (`EntityList
// [MAXENTS]`, `spawnEntity()`/`freeEntity()`/`thinkAll()`/`drawAll()`) is
// ported closely, but with three real adaptations:
//   1. `void(*think)(struct ENTITY_S*)` (a real per-entity function
//      pointer, upstream's own dispatch for player/tree/log/game-over
//      behavior) became a plain `int think` dispatch id
//      (`SKI_THINK_PLAYER`/`_GAMEOVER`/`_TREE`/`_LOG`), matched by an
//      explicit `if`/`else if` chain in `skiThinkAll()`. This dialect's
//      own reference doc (`VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md`) documents function
//      pointers (even as struct fields) as supported by the current
//      compiler - but matching this project's own established "don't be
//      the first file betting on an unproven-here pattern" caution
//      (gameCatcher.c's own header comment gives the identical reasoning
//      for the identical situation - a real `void(*draw_fun)(void*)`
//      struct field in ITS OWN upstream source), this file plays it safe
//      the same way.
//   2. `const byte *sprite[MAXFRAMES]` (4 real bitmap pointers per entity)
//      became four plain `int sprite0..sprite3` fields (one of the
//      `SKI_BMP_*` ids below, or `SKI_BMP_NONE`), for the same "avoid an
//      unproven-here pointer-as-struct-field pattern" reason - dispatched
//      to the real bitmap array via an explicit `if`/`else if` chain in
//      `skiDrawAll()`/`skiGetSpriteWH()`, mirroring gameCatcher.c's own
//      identical `flags_bm[]`-avoidance treatment.
//   3. `byte flag[MAXFLAGS]` (4 general-purpose per-entity flag slots)
//      became four plain `flag0..flag3` fields rather than an array field
//      - no other file in this project has yet exercised an array *inside*
//      a struct (every existing struct here only has scalar members, see
//      e.g. gameCatcher.c's own `CatchSprite`/gameCrazyCar.c's own
//      `CcarObstacle`), so this sticks to that same already-proven
//      scalar-fields-only shape rather than being the first to bet on an
//      untested one, for a cost of only 8 extra named fields total (4
//      sprites + 4 flags) across the whole file. Upstream's own
//      `PLAYERFLAGS` enum (`JUMP=0, JUMPCTR=1, GAMEOVER=2, PLAYERTXT=3`)
//      maps directly: `flag0`=JUMP, `flag1`=JUMPCTR, `flag2`=GAMEOVER,
//      `flag3`=PLAYERTXT.
//   `Entity *player` (a real pointer to the player's own live entity) became
//   a plain `int skiPlayerIndex`, for the same "avoid an untested pointer-
//   into-array-element pattern" reason (no other file here takes the
//   address of an array element either) - true to upstream anyway, since
//   `spawnEntity()` always returns the first free slot and the player is
//   always spawned first, immediately after a full `clearEntities()`, so
//   the player is provably always entity index 0 for the whole game.
//   `switch` statements (upstream's own random-sprite pickers in
//   `spawnLargeTree()`/`spawnSmallTree()`/`spawnLog()`, and the random
//   death-quip picker in `thinkGameOver()`) became `if`/`else if` chains -
//   no `switch` has been proven to work in this dialect yet (see
//   gamePong.c's own header comment for the same established caution).
//   One small defensive addition beyond a literal port: `skiInitEntities()`
//   explicitly zeroes each entity's own `type` field (upstream leaves it
//   uninitialized until first spawned, relying on real AVR's own
//   zero-initialized-BSS globals defaulting every never-spawned slot's
//   `type` to 0/PLAYER, which is why `clearObstacles()`'s own real
//   `EntityList[i].type == OBSTACLE` check - with no accompanying `.used`
//   guard - is harmless there) - added here purely so the same guarantee
//   holds even across this cartridge's own game-to-game relaunches within
//   one long-running process, not because upstream's own check was
//   observed to misbehave.
//
// COLLISION - A REAL BUG, FOUND AND FIXED: this file used to claim real
// Gamebuino Classic's own `gb.collideBitmapBitmap()` is itself nothing
// more than a `collideRectRect()` test against each bitmap's own real
// width/height header bytes (no genuine per-pixel comparison at all
// despite the name) - a claim explicitly flagged at the time as
// "recalled-not-re-read-this-session", not actually verified. It was
// wrong: reading the real library source directly (`more games/
// Gamebuino-Classic/Gamebuino.cpp`) shows `Gamebuino::collideBitmapBitmap()`
// genuinely does real per-overlap-pixel testing via `display.
// getBitmapPixel()` on both bitmaps - `collideRectRect()` is only used
// first, as an early-exit bounding-box pre-check before the real per-pixel
// loop, not a replacement for it (see gameDescent.c's own
// `gbCollideBitmapBitmap()` for the same real source confirming this,
// already promoted to the shared shim). `skiCollideBitmapBitmap()` below
// now calls the real `gbCollideBitmapBitmap()` primitive directly (via a
// new local `skiGetSpriteBitmap()` lookup returning each sprite id's own
// real bitmap pointer, mirroring `skiGetSpriteWH()`'s/`skiDrawAll()`'s own
// identical `if`/`else if` dispatch structure) instead of approximating
// with rectangles - real upstream's own function signature takes `int8_t`
// x/y parameters (an 8-bit range too small for this game's own real
// 192x256 map coordinates) - whether that silently truncates on genuine
// hardware is NOT something this port re-verified this session (documented
// uncertainty, not asserted as a bug); moot either way here, since this
// dialect's own full-range 32-bit `int` is used throughout with no
// narrowing step at all.
//
// SOUND: a faithful, byte-for-byte port of real `playSound(const int *snd,
// byte channel)` - `skiPlaySound(int* snd)` drives the same 5 real
// `gb.sound.command(...)` calls (note volume, instrument select, volume
// slide, pitch slide via the arpeggio command, tremolo) in upstream's own
// exact order before `gbPlayNoteChannel()`, always on channel 0 (upstream's
// own `channel` parameter is a literal `0` at every real call site). The 5
// real envelope tables from upstream's own `Sound.h` (`skiSndJump`/
// `skiSndSlide`/`skiSndCrash`/`skiSndResume`/`skiSndPause`) are copied
// verbatim (10 entries each: volume, instrument ID, volume-slide step
// duration/depth, pitch-slide step duration/depth, tremolo step
// duration/depth, pitch, duration).
//
// EEPROM: upstream's own `getHighScore()`/`saveHighScore()` read/write two
// raw EEPROM bytes directly (address 0 = low byte, address 1 = high byte -
// upstream's own local variable names for these, confusingly, are `two`
// and `one` respectively, preserved here only as a comment, not as
// deliberately-confusing identifiers) - ported through this shim's own
// `eeprom_read_byte()`/`eeprom_update_byte()` at the exact same two
// addresses, matching upstream's own exact byte order (not this project's
// own `eeprom_read_word()`/`eeprom_write_word()` helpers, since those pack
// the *opposite* byte order - high byte first - which would still work
// correctly for this game alone since it owns both the read and write
// ends exclusively, but diverges from a literal upstream transcription for
// no benefit).
//
// A REAL SIGNED-32-BIT-vs-SIGNED-16-BIT MISMATCH, FOUND AND FIXED (not
// just a preserved cosmetic quirk): this shim's own fresh/never-written
// EEPROM cells default to 255 (0xFF), matching real AVR EEPROM's own
// actual factory-erased state - so on a genuinely fresh card, both bytes
// read back 255. Upstream's own real `int getHighScore(){ long two =
// EEPROM.read(0); long one = EEPROM.read(1); return ((two<<0)&0xFFFFFF) +
// ((one<<8)&0xFFFFFFFF); }` computes this same 255+65280=65535 as an
// intermediate `unsigned long` - but its *return type* is a genuine
// 16-bit signed AVR `int`, so real hardware silently narrows 65535 down to
// its own low 16 bits at the `return` statement, reinterpreted as the
// signed value **-1**, not 65535. `highScore`/`metersTraveled` are both
// plain signed `int` upstream too (confirmed directly in `Skibuino.ino`),
// with no unsigned operand anywhere in `if(metersTraveled > highScore)` to
// launder the sign back the way e.g. gameUfoRace.c's own `unsigned int
// score` parameter does for its own structurally-identical composition -
// so on real hardware, a truly fresh cartridge's first real distance
// (any non-negative value) always beats -1, and the game's first-ever
// highscore save always succeeds. This dialect's own `int` is always a
// full 32-bit word and never narrows at a return/assignment boundary the
// way AVR's real 16-bit `int` does, so the identical formula here stays
// +65535 instead - an "impossibly high" sentinel no real distance could
// ever beat, which would silently and permanently block a fresh
// cartridge's very first highscore save (a real, save-breaking regression,
// not merely a cosmetic HUD-display difference). Fixed in
// `skiGetHighScore()` below by detecting the genuinely-fresh case directly
// (both raw bytes == 255) and returning a plain 0 instead of the composed
// 65535 - matching real hardware's own actual functional outcome (any
// real score beats the fresh sentinel), not its literal internal bit
// pattern. `gameCrabator.c`/`gameDescentIntoHell.c`'s own real upstream
// `(highscore[i]==0xFFFF) ? 0 : highscore[i]` check achieves the same
// effect for their own structurally-similar per-entry highscore tables -
// this game's own upstream never had an equivalent check to restore, so
// this fix is new, not a restoration of dropped upstream logic.
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED - every one of upstream's own real
// `const byte NAME[] PROGMEM = {...}` bitmaps (the 72x48 `gameLogo` splash,
// the 4 real 8x10 player sprites, the 4 real 16x16 large trees, the 4 real
// 8x8 small trees, and the 4 real 8x4 logs) is reproduced below as a real
// `int[N] skiXxxBitmap = { width, height, byte0, byte1, ... }` array (this
// dialect's own `int[N] name` array-declaration order, not C's `int
// name[N]`) - not one was replaced with a geometric placeholder. Every
// upstream `B00000000`-style Arduino binary literal (432 of them, just in
// `gameLogo` alone) was converted to hex mechanically via a small one-off
// Python script reading Sprite.h directly (not hand-transcribed - too
// error-prone at this size) and double-checked by recomputing each
// bitmap's own expected `ceil(width/8)*height` byte count against what the
// script actually emitted (every one of the 17 real bitmaps matched
// exactly). Every sprite here is a single, fully self-contained outline
// bitmap - none of them are backed by a separate solid GRAY/fillRect mask
// layer upstream draws first (confirmed by reading `Sprite.h` in full, the
// same real bug class gameFlappyBirdo.c's/gameParachute.c's own header
// comments document finding and fixing elsewhere in this project) - so
// there is no fill-under-bitmap layer to restore here, and no bleed-
// through risk to guard against.

// A REAL UPSTREAM MACRO-EXPANSION BUG, DELIBERATELY PRESERVED - DO NOT
// "FIX" THE MISSING OUTER PARENS: real upstream's own `#define
// CAMERAYOFFSET (LCDHEIGHT/2) + 10` has no parens around the whole
// expression, only around `LCDHEIGHT/2` - so its one real real call site,
// `cameraY = player->y - CAMERAYOFFSET;`, textually expands to `player->y

// theoretical parse quirk) via a direct side-by-side screenshot of real
// hardware, provided directly by the user: the player sprite sits
// noticeably higher on screen (around 30-40% down) than this port's own
