// Parachute (Jicehel, license: none specified upstream - no LICENSE file in
// the repo - github.com/jicehel/Parachute_Gamebuino). A Nintendo Game &
// Watch "Parachute" remake: a helicopter drops paratroopers into one of 3
// lanes, the player slides a rowboat left/right across those same 3 lanes
// to catch them before they hit the water, where a shark and drowning
// swimmers take over the animation instead. Score increases per catch, and
// the game speeds up (shorter spawn delay, faster fall rate) as the score
// grows - there is no upstream game-over condition at all (misses are
// merely tallied, never checked against any limit), so this port doesn't
// invent one either.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why).
// `random(N)`/`int(random(N))` became `arand(N)` (this dialect's own
// established RNG helper). Upstream's own blocking `gb.titleScreen(F(
// "Parachute"), titleScreenBitmap)` - called once in setup(), and again
// from inside loop() as a "pause" gesture on a Button C press, with no
// state reset either time - was converted into an explicit
// PARA_STATE_TITLE/PARA_STATE_PLAY state machine exactly like gamePong.c's
// own PongState (dismissed by a genuine Button A press, re-entered from
// play on Button C, resuming play afterward with score/lanes/parachutes
// untouched, matching upstream's own "titleScreen() as a pause menu, not a
// reset" behavior).
//
// UPDATE: real bitmap art restored. An earlier pass of this port (before
// this shim had a drawBitmap() primitive at all) replaced every one of
// upstream's own hand-drawn PROGMEM sprite bitmaps with small geometric
// stand-ins (rects/lines/circles) built from this shim's own primitives.
// Now that gbDrawBitmap()/gbDrawBitmapRotated() exist (matching real
// Gamebuino Classic's own Display::drawBitmap() format/behavior exactly -
// see gamebuinoShim.h's own header comment on those two functions), every
// one of those bitmaps has been restored below and every placeholder
// drawing function deleted - the rowboat (barque), the helicopter body
// (Helico) + single spinning-blade sprite (Helice, drawn 2-4 times per
// frame at different offsets exactly like upstream), the 5 real falling-
// paratrooper stage bitmaps (Para_1..Para_5 - stages 6 and 7 reuse Para_5
// at different coordinates, matching upstream exactly, not a 7th/8th
// distinct bitmap), the 3 real "missed paratrooper drowning" bitmaps
// (Noye_1, Noye_2, Noye_2 again horizontally flipped for the 3rd stage -
// matching upstream's own `drawBitmap(14, 39, Noye_2, 0, FLIPH)`), the 2
// real swimmer bitmaps (Nageur used for 2 stages, Parra_m for the last),
// the shark's own single fin bitmap (aileron - reused unflipped for 3
// stages and horizontally flipped for 2 more, matching upstream's own
// `shark[]` array which really is `{aileron,aileron,aileron,aileron,
// aileron,requin_m}`, not 5 distinct fin bitmaps) and full-shark bitmap
// (requin_m), the 88x48 background water bitmap (subBackgroundBitmap -
// drawn at (0,0); its rightmost 4 columns fall past this shim's own
// 84-wide LCD_WIDTH and are silently clipped by gbDrawPixel()'s own bounds
// check, exactly matching real hardware, which has the same 84px-wide
// display upstream's own bitmap already overhangs by the same 4 columns),
// and the 80x32 title-screen logo bitmap (titleScreenBitmap), now drawn in
// paraUpdateTitle() where only plain text stood before.
//
// One real upstream bitmap was found genuinely unused and was NOT ported:
// `Miss[]` (8x5) is declared but never referenced by any `drawBitmap()`
// call anywhere in the 408-line source (confirmed by checking every
// remaining reference) - dead art on real hardware too, not just here.
//
// UPDATE: real score text restored. `paraUpdatePlay()`'s own score line
// used to read "SCORE " + the number at a hand-tuned x=48, adapted for
// this shim's old fixed 8x8 font; now reads upstream's own real
// "Score :    " (with its own literal colon and trailing spaces) + the
// number at upstream's own real cursorX=30, both practical now that
// gbSetFont()/real fonts exist (upstream's own default font3x5 - its own
// `setFont(font5x7)` call here is commented out, dead code, in the real
// source). Upstream's own real `setColor(BLACK, WHITE)` (an explicit WHITE
// background so the text overwrites whatever's behind it, not just the
// "on" pixels) has no equivalent here - this shim's `gbSetColor()` only
// supports a single foreground color, the same established limitation
// gameFlappyBirdo.c's own header comment documents - harmless here since
// nothing else is ever drawn under this text before it prints.
//
// B-binary-literal conversion method: this .ino file declares every real
// bitmap byte using Arduino's `Bxxxxxxxx` binary-literal syntax (not valid
// in this project's own C dialect - only `titleScreenBitmap` and the
// sibling project's own bitmaps use plain `0x..` hex, which needed no
// conversion at all). Rather than hand-converting ~30 bitmaps' worth of
// bytes (528 of them for the background bitmap alone), every `const byte
// NAME[] PROGMEM = { width, height, B........, ... };` block was extracted
// from the real .ino source with a small Python script (regex over the
// full file, in original declaration order) that parses each `Bxxxxxxxx`
// token as base-2 and each `0x..` token as base-16, emits every byte as a
// decimal-free `0x..` hex literal (matching gameConduit.c's own existing
// bitmap-literal style in this same project), and cross-checks the
// resulting byte count against `ceil(width/8) * height` computed from
// each bitmap's own declared header - every one of the 17 real bitmaps in
// the source (16 used + the 1 dead `Miss[]` above) matched its expected
// byte count exactly, a strong end-to-end correctness signal on top of
// the conversion itself being entirely mechanical. Spot-checked several
// conversions by hand afterward against the script's own output: `barque`'s
// first two bytes `B00111000,B00000000` -> 0x38,0x0 (00111000b = 32+16+8 =
// 56 = 0x38); `Helice`'s single byte `B11111000` -> 0xF8 (128+64+32+16+8 =
// 248 = 0xF8); `Para_1`'s second byte `B00100111` -> 0x27 (32+4+2+1 = 39 =
// 0x27) - all three matched the script's own output exactly.
//
// Several upstream globals turned out to be genuinely dead code once read
// closely (confirmed by checking every remaining reference in the 408-line
// source, not assumed) and were dropped outright rather than ported:
// - `long highscore;` and `#include <EEPROM.h>` - despite the include,
//   nothing in the source ever calls EEPROM.read()/.write() anywhere, and
//   `highscore` itself is never read, written, or displayed after being
//   declared. A genuinely vestigial, never-wired-up feature - there is no
//   real high-score persistence to port through.
// - `byte gameState;` and `short x;` - declared, never read or written
//   anywhere else in the file.
// - The analog joystick support (`JoyX_pin`/`JoyX_pos`/`analogRead(...)`)
//   and `manage_joystick` - `manage_joystick` is initialized to 0 in
//   initGame() and never assigned anywhere else in the source, so every
//   `... && manage_joystick == 1` branch that would read the analog stick
//   is permanently dead even on real hardware. Vircon32 has no analog
//   stick input anyway.
// - `gb.battery.show = false;` - no battery API exists in this shim
//   (purely cosmetic on real hardware too).
//
// Two real upstream oddities found while reading the source closely:
// - Test_Barque()'s own miss-handling branch reads `Nb_Parachutes_launched
//   == 1;` where an assignment (`= 1`) was obviously intended - a bare
//   comparison statement whose result is simply discarded, so the count of
//   in-flight parachutes is never actually capped back down to 1 the way
//   the surrounding code (which *does* zero out every other slot) clearly
//   means it to be. Initially preserved exactly as upstream wrote it in
//   paraTestBoat() below (real cartridges ship with this exact behavior,
//   leaving harmless invisible "ghost" slots that quietly cycle through
//   the drowning-swimmer animation instead of disappearing immediately) -
//   **since fixed to a real `= 1` assignment at direct user request**,
//   once this behavior was explained and the user asked for the actual fix
//   rather than the faithful-typo reproduction. See paraTestBoat()'s own
//   comment for the fix itself.
// - Dessine_Para()'s own case 6 (lane 1 or lane 3 sub-position) contains a
//   single corrupted, non-ASCII character in its Y coordinate literal
//   (`gb.display.drawBitmap(16, 1<corrupted-char>, Para_5)`) - almost
//   certainly meant to be the coordinate 17, matching both the neighboring
//   lane-2 branch of the very same case and the very next case's own
//   fixed Y of 17. Normalized to 17 below (the paraFall5Bitmap draw at
//   (16, 17)) as an obvious encoding artifact with no plausible alternate
//   reading, not a load-bearing quirk.
//
// paraPosition[]'s backing array was sized 32 (PARA_MAX_PARACHUTES) rather
// than upstream's fixed 10 (Position_Parachute[10]) - a pure storage-
// capacity cushion, not a behavior change. Upstream's own
// Nb_Parachutes_launched has no explicit cap and is only indirectly kept
// in check by ordinary catch/miss removal, so at a high enough score (fast
// spawn rate, slow removal) it could in principle grow past its own
// 10-slot array - undefined behavior on real AVR hardware that often goes
// unnoticed; Vircon32 has no memory protection at all, so this port simply
// gives the array more headroom instead of reproducing that risk.
