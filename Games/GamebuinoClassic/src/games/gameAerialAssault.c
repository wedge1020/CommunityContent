// Aerial-Assault (SkylarHylar, license: none specified -
// github.com/SkylarHylar/Strike-Down). A real Joust clone.
//
// THE REPO NAME IS NOT THE GAME NAME: the GitHub repository is called
// "Strike-Down" and its Arduino sketch folder/entry file are
// `StrikeDown/StrikeDown.ino`, but the repo's own README.md says, in full,
// "# Aerial-Assault / A Joust Clone for the Gamebuino!" - so the real title
// is Aerial-Assault, and that is what this game is registered under in
// menuGameList.c. The sketch itself never prints its own name anywhere (its
// only title-screen text is a single space), so the README is the only real
// naming evidence either way, and it is unambiguous.
//
// LICENSE: none. Confirmed by listing every file in the staged repository
// directly (`.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, the prebuilt
// `STRIKE.elf`/`STRIKE.hex`, and `StrikeDown/`'s own three `.ino` tabs) -
// there is no LICENSE/COPYING file of any kind, and a grep for
// "licen"/"copyright"/"author" across all three source files and the README
// returns nothing at all. Registered as "None specified", matching this
// cartridge's own treatment of every other unlicensed port.
//
// Source: a real, standard multi-tab Arduino sketch, all three tabs read in
// full before porting - `StrikeDown.ino` (setup + the real `gb.menu()`
// driven loop: Survival / Status / Controls / Options / Change Game),
// `player.ino` (the entire game, one blocking `play()` function), and
// `sprites.ino` (13 PROGMEM bitmaps).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The real mechanic, as this game actually implements it
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A fixed (non-scrolling) 84x48 arena of platforms. The player flaps upward
// one pixel at a time (Button A or B, each press subtracting 1 from the
// gravity accumulator) and walks/drifts left-right with a real -2..+2
// velocity, wrapping around both screen edges. Three enemy types share the
// arena, each spawned in a random count per stage:
//   * FLOATER - drifts horizontally at a constant 1px/tick, jittering
//     between two adjacent rows of its own randomly chosen "line" height.
//   * BOUNCER - accelerates toward the player in both axes (velocity capped
//     at 1px/tick each way) and, uniquely, does NOT kill on a level hit: it
//     knocks the player back and takes recoil itself.
//   * HUNTER - tracks the player's height with a gravity accumulator and
//     closes horizontally at a flat 1px/tick. Kills on a level hit.
// Plus a PTERODACTYL, a real timed hazard (it appears once `dactyltime`
// counts down to 0 and then flies across the screen forever, oscillating
// one pixel per tick toward the player's height, wrapping at both edges).
//
// The Joust rule itself, as actually written here, is a plain height
// comparison at collision time - NOT the arcade original's relative-height-
// of-the-mounts rule, and not a velocity comparison:
//   * player Y <= enemy Y - 1  ->  the player wins; the enemy is knocked
//     down-right by (+2,+2) and turns into an EGG, which then falls under
//     gravity until it lands on a platform.
//   * otherwise               ->  the player dies (loses a life), except
//     against the bouncer, which only shoves.
//   * player Y <= dactyl Y - 3 (a deeper 3px margin, not 1) -> the
//     pterodactyl is merely reset (`dactyltime = 450`), never killed.
// Touching a downed egg collects it: that enemy's remaining count drops by
// one and it respawns at the current spawn point. Clearing every enemy
// advances the stage, which progressively REMOVES platforms (the two
// bridges go at stage 3, the middle platform at 6, the left ledge at 9, the
// right ledge at 11) - the game's only real difficulty curve.
//
// NO HIGHSCORE, NO EEPROM: confirmed by grep across all three real source
// files - there is no `EEPROM.h` include, no `EEPROM.read`/`.write`, and no
// score variable of any kind. The only progress readout is the live stage
// number, shown during each stage's own rest period. Nothing was invented
// here, matching this project's own "don't invent a highscore concept real
// upstream never had" precedent.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Dialect rewrites (this project's standing conventions)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site became a plain `gbY(...)` call (this
// dialect has no classes/methods - see gamePong.c's own header comment).
// `boolean` became `bool`. Array declarations use this dialect's required
// `TYPE[N] name` order. `random(min,max)` (Arduino's own EXCLUSIVE upper
// bound) became `min + arand(max - min)`; `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became
// `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a documented no-op. `gb.battery.show = ...` (a real
// hardware battery indicator, toggled in four places here) was dropped
// outright, matching gamePong.c. Global naming prefix: `aer`.
//
// All 13 real PROGMEM bitmaps are restored verbatim below, every
// `B00000000`-style Arduino binary literal mechanically converted to hex by
// a one-off script (this dialect has no binary-literal syntax) with each
// table's own byte count checked against its real `{width,height}` header
// first - all 13 exact, nothing redrawn or approximated.
//
// Real icon glyphs `\25`/`\26`/`\27` (octal - ASCII 21/22/23, the real
// Gamebuino A/B/C button icons) cannot be embedded in a plain quoted string
// literal here, so each line using one is an explicit `int[]` array - the
// established precedent from gameTaquin.c/gameSmash.c.
//
// SOUND: upstream plays exactly two real notes (a flap and a death), each
// on real channel 1, each followed by 2-3 raw `gb.sound.command(...)`
// tracker effects (a flap's own volume/instrument/tremolo slides; a
// death's own instrument/pitch-slide) - a real, faithful port of both via
// this shim's own `gbSoundCommand()`/`gbPlayNoteChannel()` primitives (a
// direct port of real Sound.h's own per-channel tracker commands),
// preserving upstream's own real, literal call order (the note plays
// first, the command() slides are issued right after it, not before).
// The 4 identical real death-sound sites (a repeated
// `playNote(1,28,1)`+2`command()`s+`alive=false;`+`lives--` block) are
// still consolidated into one `aerKillPlayer()` helper, called from all 4
// real sites.
//
// BLOCKING WIDGETS -> EXPLICIT STATES (gamePong.c's own established
// treatment, and gameSmash.c's precedent for this exact menu shape):
//   * `gb.titleScreen(F(" "), Title)` (setup) and `gb.titleScreen(Title)`
//     (the menu's own cancel path) -> AER_STATE_TITLE. Real
//     `Gamebuino::titleScreen()` prints the passed name at cursor (0,12)
//     and draws the logo at `(0, 12 + logoOffset)`, where `logoOffset` is
//     the active font's own real height when a name string is passed and 0
//     when it is not (the formula this project already established by
//     reading the real Gamebuino.cpp - see gameInvaders.c/gameSmash.c). The
//     two real call sites therefore differ: setup passes `" "` with font5x7
//     active (height 8) -> logo at (0,20), and the cancel path passes no
//     name at all -> logo at (0,12). Both are reproduced, carried by
//     `aerTitleLogoY`. The name string `" "` is a single invisible space,
//     so a "PRESS A" hint (this project's own established stand-in for the
//     real blinking A-icon prompt) fills that line instead. NOTE the 64x30
//     logo genuinely overflows the bottom of the screen by 2 rows in the
//     setup case (20+30 = 50 > 48) - real hardware clips it exactly the
//     same way, so it is left alone rather than nudged up.
//   * `gb.menu(menu, 5)` -> AER_STATE_MENU, a hand-rolled 5-item list with
//     a ">" cursor (gameDigger.c/gameSmash.c precedent - this shim has no
//     generic menu widget by design). Real `Gamebuino::menu()`'s own button
//     semantics are reproduced: A confirms (plays OK, returns the item),
//     B or C cancels (plays Cancel, returns -1 -> the title screen), and
//     the highlight resets to item 0 on every fresh entry, exactly like the
//     real widget's own `activeItem = 0`. Its slide-in animation is not
//     reproduced (cosmetic, no gameplay effect).
//   * `play()`'s own `while(true){ if(gb.update()){...} }`, and the three
//     `while(1)` screens behind menu items 1/2/3 -> AER_STATE_PLAY /
//     _STATUS / _CONTROLS / _OPTIONS. `pause` and the `lives <= 0` game
//     over are kept as upstream's own flags inside the play state rather
//     than split into further states, since upstream itself treats them as
//     sub-modes of one screen.
//   * `gb.changeGame()` (menu item 4 - a real "flash a different game off
//     the SD card" OS feature) has no Vircon32 equivalent, the same class
//     of real-hardware-only call already dropped for gamePirates' own
//     `load_game()`. This cartridge's real equivalent gesture is the global
//     Start-button quit dialog handled by portVircon32.c. The menu entry is
//     kept (so the real 5-item menu still reads as it does on hardware) and
//     selecting it returns to the title screen - the closest available
//     outcome, matching gameSmash.c's own identical decision.
//
// `gb.getCpuLoad()`/`gb.getFreeRam()` (the whole point of the Status
// screen) are real hardware introspection with no meaning on a virtual
// console. The screen is kept so the real menu still has five working
// entries, showing literal "N/A" placeholders rather than invented numbers
// - exactly what gameSmash.c already does for the same two calls.
//
// The real `gb.display.print(F("    Loading...."))` printed once before
// `play()` starts, with no delay before the next `gb.update()` overwrites
// it, was dropped - purely cosmetic, and whether it is ever visible for
// even one frame depends on real SPI/display-flip timing this project
// cannot reproduce (gameSmash.c set this precedent for the identical line).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Real upstream bugs and quirks
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1) **`case 2:` (Controls) has no `break;`** on real hardware, so backing
//    out of the Controls screen with Button B does not return to the menu -
//    it falls straight through into `case 3:` (Options) instead. Ported
//    faithfully at first, but fixed on direct user request once live
//    testing found it a genuine navigation annoyance, not just a curiosity:
//    `aerUpdateControls()`'s own B handler now calls `aerBeginMenu()`
//    directly, matching every other sub-screen's own B-handler shape
//    (`aerUpdateStatus()` right above it). The only quirk in this list that
//    is NOT reproduced bit-for-bit - every other one below still is.
//
// 2) **Four separate `wait == 0 || 10`-style conditions are always true.**
//    `(wait == 0 || 10)`, `(wait == 0 || 5 || 10 || 15)` parse as
//    `(wait == 0) || 10` etc - a bare non-zero constant as the right
//    operand, so the whole clause is unconditionally true and the intended
//    "only on these frames" throttle never happens at all. This is not
//    cosmetic: it is why the pterodactyl chases the player's height at a
//    full 1px per tick, why the floater moves every single tick rather than
//    every fifth, and why the floater's own row jitters every tick. All
//    four sites are written here as the unconditional code they really are,
//    each with the original condition quoted in a comment.
//
// 3) **`floaterleft = random(0,1)` can only ever produce 0.** Arduino's
//    `random(min,max)` has an exclusive upper bound, so this is a constant
//    `false` - the floater's entire leftward-movement branch (and its
//    NOFLIP sprite direction) is real, permanently dead code on hardware
//    too. Ported as `arand(1)`, which is 0 for exactly the same reason.
//
// 4) **`spawn = random(0,2)` never produces 2**, so the third spawn point
//    (76,11) is likewise unreachable. Kept anyway, byte for byte.
//
// 5) **The spawn point used when an egg is collected is one tick stale.**
//    Each egg-collect block re-rolls `spawn` and THEN reads `spawnx`/
//    `spawny` - but those two are only recomputed from `spawn` at the top
//    of the next tick, so the enemy actually respawns at the PREVIOUS
//    roll's coordinates. Preserved by keeping the exact statement order.
//
// 6) **The egg-collect tests run against every enemy every tick, whether
//    or not that enemy is currently an egg** - they test the egg bitmap at
//    the live enemy's own position. So a single collision can both kill the
//    player (via the enemy test) and consume/respawn that enemy (via the
//    egg test) on the same tick. Preserved by keeping the same test order.
//
// 7) **The lives readout is drawn inverted and one heart is misplaced.**
//    `if(lives < 1) drawBitmap(18,0,life);` - a heart at the TOP of the
//    screen, and each condition is `<` rather than `>=`, so hearts appear
//    as lives are LOST, not as they remain. Copied verbatim.
//
// 8) **The Pterodactyl option does nothing.** The Options screen toggles a
//    real `pterodactyl` boolean that `play()` never reads even once
//    (confirmed by grep across all three files) - the pterodactyl always
//    spawns regardless. The option is kept and still toggles the variable,
//    exactly as on hardware.
//
// 9) **The Options screen's UP/DOWN are inverted** (UP increments the
//    option index, DOWN decrements). Kept.
//
// 10) **Enemy/bridge sprites are drawn flipped but collided unflipped.**
//    Every `drawBitmap(..., NOROT, someflip)` has a matching
//    `collideBitmapBitmap(...)` with no flip argument at all - real
//    `Gamebuino::collideBitmapBitmap()` has no such parameter, so real
//    hardware has this same mismatch. It is genuinely visible on the
//    bridge, whose second row is `0xFF,0x00` (solid on the left half only)
//    but which is drawn FLIPH at (0,40): the drawn solid half and the
//    collidable solid half are opposite. Preserved - this shim's
//    `gbCollideBitmapBitmap()` is a direct port of the real one and behaves
//    identically.
//
// 11) **A stage-gated platform still swallows the else-if chain.** The
//    player's landing chain tests `platform2`/`platform3` collision
//    unconditionally and only acts on the result `if(stage < 6)` etc - so
//    once a platform has been removed, occupying the space where it used to
//    be still consumes the chain and skips the final `else` branch, leaving
//    the player neither grounded nor accumulating gravity (a real invisible
//    "hover pocket"). Preserved.
//
// 12) **The hunter's landing chain disagrees with the player's.** Its
//    right-hand `platform3` case is gated on `stage < 6` where the player's
//    is `stage < 11`, and both its `platform3` cases snap to y=11 from a
//    `< 13` test where the player uses y=9 from `< 11`. Copied verbatim,
//    inconsistencies included.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SHIM GAPS: none. Every primitive needed already exists and is used
// directly - gbDrawBitmap/gbDrawBitmapRotated, gbCollideBitmapBitmap,
// gbDrawRect, gbPrintString/gbPrintNumber, gbPressed/gbRepeat, gbSetFont,
// gbPlayNote/gbPlayOK/gbPlayCancel, gbSetFrameRate, arand. The only real
// upstream calls without an equivalent (`gb.menu`, `gb.titleScreen`,
// `gb.changeGame`, `gb.getCpuLoad`, `gb.getFreeRam`, `gb.battery.show`,
// `gb.sound.command`) are each an already-established, already-documented
// project-wide scope decision, not a new gap.
