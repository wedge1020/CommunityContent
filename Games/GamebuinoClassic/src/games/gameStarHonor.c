// StarHonor - a roguelike space adventure. Original Arduboy game "Star
// Honor" by Wenceslao Villanueva Jr (2016, MIT license - see the real
// upstream LICENSE file, a single-holder MIT grant naming him directly).
// The source ported here is wuuff's own unofficial Gamebuino Classic port
// of that original game (README.md: "Unofficial Gamebuino port by wuuff"),
// which already targets the real Gamebuino Classic library directly
// (`Gamebuino arduboy;` - confirmed by reading Globals.cpp) rather than
// real Arduboy2 hardware.
//
// A REAL STRUCTURAL WRINKLE this port had to check first: the repo also
// ships `ArduboyCustom.cpp/h` and `coreCustom.cpp/h`, suggesting a second
// compatibility shim layer. Read in full before writing anything here -
// both turned out to be genuinely empty (`coreCustom.h` is just an
// `#ifndef ArduboyCoreCustom_h` include guard with nothing inside it,
// `ArduboyCustom.h` is just `#include "coreCustom.h"` under an
// `Arduboy_h` guard, `.cpp` files are empty besides their own #include).
// Their only real job is making a stray `#include <Arduboy.h>`-style line
// elsewhere resolve to nothing, in case one exists (it doesn't, in this
// source tree). `Globals.cpp` proves the real wiring directly: `Gamebuino
// arduboy;` - a genuine, real Gamebuino Classic instance, with every
// `arduboy.display.x()`/`arduboy.buttons.x()` call site already calling
// straight into the real library. So there was no second translation
// layer to route around or port - every `arduboy.x.y(...)` call site
// below was mechanically rewritten straight to this project's own
// `gbY(...)` shim primitive, exactly like every other ported game.
//
// Every real C++ class was flattened into a plain struct plus free
// functions taking an explicit pointer (this dialect has no classes/
// methods/operator overloading):
// - `Vector2d` (real x/y float pair with `+`/`-`/`*`/`+=`/`-=`/`*=`
//   operator overloads, `Magnitude()`/`MagnitudeSquared()`/`Normalize()`/
//   `Rotate()`) -> `StarVec2` struct + `starVecAdd`/`starVecSub`/
//   `starVecScale`/`starVecAddInPlace`/`starVecMag`/`starVecMagSq`/
//   `starVecNormalize`/`starVecRotate`, all taking explicit in/out
//   pointers (a `Vector2d` return by value is 2 words - over this
//   dialect's real 1-word function-return limit). Real `Dot()` and the
//   component-wise `Vector2d*Vector2d` operator are both genuinely dead
//   code (declared, never called anywhere in the real gameplay source -
//   confirmed via a full grep) and were not ported, matching this
//   project's own established "don't port genuinely unused methods"
//   precedent.
// - `Ship` -> `StarShip` struct + `starShip*()` functions taking an
//   explicit `StarShip*`. There is only ever one real instance
//   (`PlayerShip`), kept as a single global `starPlayerShip` (not
//   malloc'd, matching this project's own "flatten a single-instance
//   class into a bare global" convention).
// - `Planetoid` -> `StarPlanet` struct, held as a real `StarPlanet[10]
//   starPlanets` array-of-struct global (the same proven pattern as e.g.
//   gameDescent.c's own `DescentMonster[8] descentMonster`) instead of
//   the real upstream's own array-of-`new`'d-pointers - `Planetoid**
//   Planets`/`InitializePlanetsArray()`'s own allocation step is
//   unneeded here since every one of a fresh array's 10 real elements'
//   fields is always fully written by `starNewMap()` before any of them
//   is ever read.
// - `SelectionArrow`/`SelectionLocation` (a real circular doubly-linked
//   list of positions) -> flattened much further than a 1:1 struct port,
//   since only two real instances ever exist and `CurrentSelectionArrow`
//   (used throughout the real status screen) is assigned exactly once,
//   at boot, to `RepairSelectionArrow`, and never reassigned anywhere
//   else in the real source (confirmed via a full grep) - so the real
//   "current selection arrow" indirection is dead abstraction. Ported as
//   two small parallel coordinate-table + position-index pairs
//   (`starOverviewX/Y`+`starRepairArrowPos`,
//   `starCombatX/Y`+`starCombatArrowPos`) instead of a linked list.
// - `Text` (a real singleton instance, `TextManager`) -> flattened into
//   plain globals (`starTextOverTimeRunning`/`starFramesToNextChar`/
//   `starCharIndex`) and free functions, the same single-instance
//   treatment as `Ship`. Real `DisplayText()`'s own per-character
//   `arduboy.display.drawChar()` loop (with real per-font spacing
//   baked in as `tWidth=3,tHeight=5,tPadding=1`) is not reimplemented at
//   all - this shim's own `gbPrintString()` already reproduces that exact
//   spacing (its default font, `gbFont3x5`, IS `{3,5}` with the same
//   real "+1" inter-char/line spacing convention), so
//   `starDisplayTextRaw()` is just `gbCursorX=x;gbCursorY=y;
//   gbPrintString(text);` - the real per-character loop upstream needed
//   to hand-roll is exactly what this shim's own primitive already does.
//   Real `DisplayTextClear()`'s own "draw small, discover it's
//   multi-line, redraw bigger" double-draw shape (not just its final
//   visual result) is preserved exactly in `starDisplayTextClear()`,
//   including the same real first-pass small-clear-box draw before the
//   line count is even known.
//
// `bitmaps.h` already uses this project's own real Gamebuino `{width,
// height, byte0, byte1, ...}` bitmap format directly (not a raw,
// dimension-less Arduboy/Adafruit-GFX-style array) - this is a genuine
// Gamebuino port, not a mechanical Arduboy-bitmap carryover, so no
// width/height-prepending was needed. Every real `B00011110`-style
// Arduino binary literal (a syntax this dialect has no equivalent for)
// was mechanically converted to decimal via a small offline Python
// script, verified byte-count-exact against each bitmap's own declared
// `ceil(width/8)*height` size before use. `PlanetHome_16_64` is a real,
// confirmed upstream quirk worth noting: its own declared height is 48
// (not 64, despite the array's own name) - the real source has the first
// and last 8 rows of a would-be 64-row bitmap commented out, leaving
// exactly 48 real active rows, matching the declared header exactly; the
// misleading `_64` in the name is preserved only in spirit (kept as
// `starPlanetHomeBmp`, no `_64`/`_48` suffix at all, sidestepping the
// question of which number to preserve).
//
// No custom per-pixel bitmap-masking helper of any kind was needed here
// (checked explicitly per this batch's own standing instruction to watch
// for the "Pirates" per-pixel-call-storm mistake) - every sprite/planet/
// ship/UI bitmap draws via a single opaque `gbDrawBitmap()` call each,
// and `StarField`'s own 20 individual stars each draw via exactly one
// `gbDrawPixel()` call per star per tick (the genuinely fine, intended
// use of that primitive for a field of independent points - not a
// masked-sprite blit loop).
//
// No collision/hit-detection in this game depends on the ship's own
// facing/rotation at all (checked explicitly per this batch's own
// standing instruction, after the sibling "Pirates" project's own
// facing-dependent hitbox bug) - the ship's rotation only ever affects
// (a) which of 8 pre-rotated bitmap sprites is drawn
// (`starPlayerBitmaps[shipFacing]`) and (b) the direction of the real
// thrust vector for flight physics (`starShipCalcThrust()`'s own
// `starVecRotate()` call). Planet "hailing" detection - the only real
// collision-like check in the whole game - is pure distance
// (`starVecMagSq(&distance) < 256`, a fixed-radius circle test),
// verified directly by reading `DrawMap()`/`starDrawMap()`: it never
// reads `ShipRotation`/`shipFacing` at all.
//
// EEPROM: despite this project's own porting-priority audit flagging
// this game as a "real EEPROM save" candidate, reading every real source
// file found no actual EEPROM read/write call anywhere at all - the only
// real hit, across all 22 files, is `StarHonor.ino`'s own `#include
// <EEPROM.h>` line, which is never followed by a single real
// `EEPROM.read()`/`.write()` call anywhere in the whole game (confirmed
// via a full case-insensitive grep across every `.cpp`/`.h`/`.ino` file).
// This game has no real highscore/save concept at all - it's a single
// continuous playthrough (win by reaching Sector 7, or lose to hull
// damage or the countdown clock), with a plain in-place `Reset` state
// starting a fresh run, not a persisted score. This is the exact same
// "confirmed zero real EEPROM calls, despite looking like a candidate"
// situation this project already hit once before with `gameShipwrek.c`
// (see that file's own header comment, and this project's own
// `CLAUDE.md` "Twenty more games ported (batch 3)" section) - no
// `eeprom_*()` call was added here either, matching that precedent
// rather than inventing a new save feature past what real upstream ever
// shipped.
//
// Real upstream quirks/bugs found and deliberately preserved (none of
// these crash or make the game unplayable, so none were "fixed"):
// - `Neutral_Response_A/B/C/D` real 4-entry array. `SetupEncounter()`
//   preserved.
// - The real "shields holding" text-buffer index-advance bug in
//   `EncouterUpdate()`'s own case 4: after printing
//   `CombatShipShieldDamage` as text, the real code computes how many
//   *extra* digit-positions to advance the buffer index by using
//   `CombatShipDamage` (a different, usually-stale global from a
//   previous combat round - or 0, on a fresh game) instead of
//   `CombatShipShieldDamage` (the value actually just printed) - a real
//   copy-paste variable mix-up. This can misalign the following literal
//   text in `typeBuffer`, a cosmetic display glitch only (the buffer is
//   still always properly null-terminated at whatever index results, no
//   overflow past `typeBuffer`'s own real 128-cell size in any reachable
//   case). Preserved exactly - `starDigitExtra(starCombatShipDamage)` is
//   called at that exact spot, not `starCombatShipShieldDamage`.
// - `Ship::RepairSystem()`'s real "Engines and Shields swapped" ordering
//   in `RepairedText[]` (upstream's own header comment above that array
//   admits this directly) - `starRepairedText[]` keeps the identical
//   order.
//
// One real change from upstream, made specifically to avoid a genuine
// crash risk on this platform (not a cosmetic preference): the real
// `EncouterUpdate()` damage-report `Text::CopyIntoBuffer(DamageReportXxx,
// index, N)` calls all pass an `N` LARGER than each string's own real
// length (verified precisely with an offline script against every real
// `CopyIntoBuffer` call site in the source: `DamageReportCrew` is a real
// 19-character string but copied with count 27; `DamageReportHull` is 12
// but copied with 21; `DamageReportWeapons` is 12 but copied with 29;
// `DamageReportShields` is 18 but copied with 22; `DamageReportEngines`
// is 20 but copied with 24 - every other real `CopyIntoBuffer` call in
// the whole game checked out exact). On real AVR PROGMEM this just reads
// a few genuinely harmless bytes of whatever constant happens to sit
// next in flash. On this platform the same over-read could pull an
// arbitrary adjacent global's raw bit pattern (not necessarily a small
// printable character code) into `typeBuffer`, which later gets handed
// straight to `gbDrawChar()`/`gbPrintString()` as if it were real
// character data - a sufficiently large/negative "character code" read
// this way risks an out-of-bounds font-table index, a real potential
// hard crash, not merely a cosmetic one. Fixed by using each string's
// own real, correct length instead of the buggy upstream constant at
// those 5 call sites only - every other real `CopyIntoBuffer` count in
// the file (verified exact) is untouched.
//
// Two small, deliberate simplifications, both documented here rather
// than silently changed:
// - Real `setup()`'s own blocking system `arduboy.titleScreen(F("Star
//   Honor\nWenceslao Villanueva\nPort by Wuuff"))` (this shim has no
//   `gbTitleScreen()` primitive at all - every other ported game
//   converts a real blocking `titleScreen()` call into its own explicit
//   title *state* instead, e.g. gamePong.c's own `PONG_STATE_TITLE`) is
//   not shown as a separate step before the real game's own custom
//   `TitleLoop` state - the genuine, already-distinct `TitleLoop` state
//   (a starfield background, "Star Honor" typed out over time, and the
//   credited author underneath) already provides an equivalent
//   title-plus-author display gated on a real button press, so the two
//   real, back-to-back title screens collapse into just entering
//   `STAR_STATE_TITLELOOP` directly - the same "skip the redundant
//   system title screen, the game's own first state already covers it"
//   shape as every other ported game here.
// - Real `arduboy.buttons.pressed(BTN_C)` (mid-`GetInput()`) calls a
//   second blocking system `arduboy.titleScreen(F("Paused"))` - since
//   that real primitive doesn't exist here either, this is ported as a
//   genuine new `STAR_STATE_PAUSED` state instead (freezes whichever
//   real state was active, shows "PAUSED"/"PRESS A", resumes on a real
//   A-press - Gamebuino's own real `titleScreen()` dismiss button is
//   also A, matching e.g. gamePong.c's own already-established
//   precedent) rather than dropping Button-C pause entirely.
//
// Dialect notes specific to this file: no ternary operator anywhere (all
// of `PlayerUpdate()`'s own real `(cond) ? a : b` chains for wrapping
// `ShipRotation` into [0,360) became plain `if`/`else`); no array-typed
// struct member is used anywhere (per this project's own still-unproven-
// pattern caution from `gamebuino-solitaire`'s own header comment) -
// `crewCharArray`/`maxCrewCharArray`/`fuelCharArray` (real `char[4]`
// members of `Ship`) became three separate top-level `int[4]` globals
// instead, since there is only ever one real `Ship` instance anyway.
// Pointer-typed struct members (`int* bitmap`) are used freely - already
// a separately-proven-safe pattern elsewhere in this project (e.g.
// gameBRally.c's own `int* sprite`).
//
// A real, live-reported bug: combat never ended, planet defense drifting
// further negative every round instead of stopping at a win. Root cause:
// real upstream's `EncouterUpdate()` combat-calc `switch` case has an
// early `break;` in its own victory branch, skipping the shield-damage
// calc and the case's own trailing `nextSequence = 9` below it - the only
// thing that makes `nextSequence = 15` (victory) actually stick. This
// dialect has no `switch`, so that whole case became an `if`/`else if`
// chain - and the mechanical conversion missed that the trailing
// `nextSequence = 9` needs to move inside the win-check's own `else` to
// reproduce the dropped `break`'s effect; left unconditional, it
// overwrote the just-set victory sequence back to 9 (damage report) every
// single round. Fixed by nesting it inside the `else`, matching real
// upstream's own early-exit control flow exactly - see the inline comment
// at the fix site for the full reasoning.
