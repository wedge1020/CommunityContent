// Asterocks (Yoda Zhang / "yodasvideoarcade", license: none specified -
// yodasvideoarcade.com/gamebuino.php). A real Asteroids clone: rotate and
// thrust a small ship around a wrapping playfield, shoot/split drifting
// rocks into smaller pieces, dodge (or shoot) a UFO that spawns once the
// score climbs and shoots back, survive on 3 lives across escalating
// levels, with a periodic bonus life every 10000 points. One of 5
// "yoda-*" games sharing this author's own file-split convention
// (asterocks.ino/standard.ino/specific.ino/nonstandard.ino/images.ino/
// sounds.ino) - only this one game (asterocks) was read/ported here.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a
// plain `gbY(...)` function call (this dialect has no classes/methods -
// see gamePong.c's own header comment). `gb.display.cursorX =`/
// `cursorY =` ported unchanged (plain globals here too). `gb.display.
// print(...)` split into `gbPrintString()`/`gbPrintNumber()` (no
// overloading in this dialect). `random(N)` became `arand(N)` (this
// dialect's own established RNG helper); `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became
// `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a documented no-op. `gb.battery.show = false;`
// was dropped outright, matching gamePong.c's own precedent (purely
// cosmetic on real hardware). Upstream's C++ `and`/`or` alternative
// operators became `&&`/`||`. Real `byte` fields (upstream used `byte`
// throughout for lives/gamelevel/most speed and type fields) became
// plain `int` - unlike `uint8_t`/`int16_t`/etc, `byte` itself isn't one
// of avrCompat.h's own aliased AVR fixed-width types, but the exact same
// "every AVR fixed-width int type costs range/packing but nothing else
// once flattened to Vircon32's own single 32-bit int" reasoning documented
// there applies unchanged.
//
// Every global from this game uses an `aster`-prefixed name (checked
// against every other `src/games/*.c` file first - not already used).
//
// ---- Bitmaps - restored as real gbDrawBitmap() calls, not placeholders ----
// Every real PROGMEM bitmap byte in images.ino was converted from
// Arduino's `B00000000`-style binary literals to hex (`0x..`, this
// dialect has no binary-literal syntax) and copied verbatim, one plain
// int per original byte: `asterLogoBitmap` (the 64x26 splash/title logo),
// `asterShipFrames` (20 real 7x7 frames - indices 0-15 are the ship's own
// 16 rotation headings, indices 15-19 double up as a 5-frame death/
// explosion animation, exactly as upstream's own `playership[20][9]`
// table and `handledeath()`'s own `i = 19 - deadtimer/10` index formula
// use it - frame 15 is shared between "pointing up-left" and "first
// explosion frame", not a mistake, just upstream reusing one table for
// two purposes), `asterRockFrames` (12 real 10x10 frames - upstream's
// own 3-tier size system: types 0-3 = big, 4-7 = medium, 8-11 = small,
// selected by the exact same `asterocktype>3`/`>7` comparisons used
// throughout for both collision-box sizing and split/score-bonus logic),
// `asterUfoFrames` (2 real 7x5 frames - the two UFO types), and
// `asterBulletBitmap` (one real 3x3 frame, shared by both player and UFO
// shots). No bitmap here is preceded by a separate GRAY mask/fill layer
// anywhere in the real source (checked every drawBitmap call site in
// images.ino/specific.ino/standard.ino/nonstandard.ino directly) - the
// mask-bleed bug class found twice in gameFlappyBirdo.c does not apply to
// this game at all.
//
// Upstream keeps these as genuine 2D PROGMEM tables (`playership[20][9]`,
// `asterocks[12][22]`, `ufo[2][7]`) and indexes a whole row at a time
// (`playership[playershiprotation]`) directly into `drawBitmap()`. This
// port keeps that exact same shape (`int[20][9] asterShipFrames`, etc.)
// rather than splitting into 20/12/2 separately-named flat arrays -
// confirmed against VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md section 4 ("arrays decay to
// pointers as parameters, as usual") that indexing one row out of a 2D
// array and passing it to a function expecting `int*` is a supported,
// documented pattern in this dialect, not something that needed
// discovering by trial and error.
//
// ---- Sound ----
// `playsoundfx(fxno, channel)` upstream builds a small "FX Synth" preset
// each call via `gb.sound.command(...)` (waveform/instrument, volume
// slide, pitch/arpeggio slide) before `gb.sound.playNote(pitch, duration,
// channel)` - `asterPlaySoundFx(fx, channel)` is a real, faithful port of
// this using this shim's own `gbSoundCommand()`/`gbPlayNoteChannel()`
// primitives (a direct port of real Sound.h's own per-channel tracker
// commands - see gamebuinoShim.h's own Sound section). `asterSoundFx[10][8]`
// is a verbatim copy of upstream's own `soundfx[10][8]` table (all 10 rows/
// 8 columns checked against the real `sounds.ino` byte-for-byte), and every
// one of upstream's 11 real `playsoundfx(fx, channel)` call sites now
// passes the same real channel number upstream itself uses at that exact
// site.
//
// ---- The blocking gb.titleScreen() calls -> ASTER_STATE_SPLASH ----
// Upstream calls the real, blocking `gb.titleScreen(text, gamelogo)` at
// three real call sites: once in setup() (the boot splash), once from
// inside showtitle() when Button C is pressed (using caption "Yoda's",
// no leading spaces), and once from inside handleplayership() when Button
// C is pressed mid-game (using caption "    Yoda's", WITH leading spaces -
// a trivial upstream inconsistency between the two C-press call sites,
// preserved exactly via a boolean flag rather than "fixed" to match,
// since it's harmless either way). All three became one explicit
// ASTER_STATE_SPLASH state (matching gamePong.c's own worked "blocking
// loop -> explicit resumable state" pattern), dismissed by a genuine
// fresh `gbPressed(BTN_A)` (armed globally by `md_armInputAGate()`),
// always transitioning to ASTER_STATE_TITLE afterward - matching all
// three real call sites' own eventual real behavior (setup()'s own
// splash sets gamestatus="title" directly after the blocking call
// returns; showtitle()'s own C-press leaves gamestatus untouched, but it
// was already "title" going in; handleplayership()'s own C-press sets
// gamestatus="title" directly too). Real Display::titleScreen()'s own
// internal layout isn't available anywhere in this game's own .ino
// sources (it lives inside the real, closed Gamebuino library itself,
// only its two arguments - a caption string and a bitmap - are visible
// here), so this state's own screen is an approximation: the same logo
// bitmap at the same (10,13) position showtitle() itself already uses for
// the exact same asset, the real caption text, and an added "PRESS A"
// hint line (upstream's own real titleScreen() almost certainly shows
// some real dismiss-prompt of its own; this is the closest documented
// stand-in without inventing new layout from nothing).
//
// Upstream's own real gamestatus string state machine ("newgame"/
// "newlevel"/"newlife"/"running"/"title"/"gameover") became an int enum,
// dispatched in gameAsterocks_update() using the exact same relative
// order loop() itself checks them in (newgame, newlevel, newlife,
// running, title, gameover - splash appended last, its own position
// doesn't interact with anything below). This exact order matters and
// was preserved deliberately, not just for readability: loop() uses
// independent sequential `if`s, not an if/else-if chain, so on the real
// hardware a genuine same-tick CASCADE happens every time a new game/
// level/life starts - newgame() flips status to "newlevel", and since
// the very next `if (gamestatus=="newlevel")` check in the same loop()
// call re-reads the now-updated variable, newlevel() runs too, then
// newlife(), then the "running" block itself, ALL within the one same
// real gb.update() tick - so no blank/cleared frame is ever visible
// between pressing A on the title screen and seeing real gameplay.
// Every OTHER transition in the source (title->newgame, running->title,
// title->splash, gameover->title, splash->title) instead moves to a
// state whose own `if` check already ran earlier in loop()'s fixed order
// this same tick, so real hardware shows one genuinely blank/cleared
// frame at each of those specific transitions before the new state's own
// first real draw call happens the following tick. This port reproduces
// BOTH behaviors exactly, for real, simply by writing five independent
// sequential `if`s below in loop()'s own exact order (not an else-if
// chain) rather than the usual single-state-per-tick dispatch pattern
// gamePong.c/gameAgaruino.c use - a deliberate, load-bearing deviation
// from that usual pattern, not an oversight (dialect rule 4 only bans
// `switch`, it doesn't require every dispatcher to be mutually exclusive).
//
// Button C mid-game (pause-to-splash) is checked at the very TOP of
// asterUpdateRunning() and returns immediately, skipping the rest of that
// tick's gameplay logic - matching gamePong.c's own established
// approximation for exactly this "blocking call used as a pause gesture"
// shape (upstream's own version has the check at the very END of
// handleplayership() instead, with the real blocking call meaning the
// REST of that tick's other handler calls - shots/rocks/ufo/etc - still
// run to completion afterward on real hardware before the screen ever
// actually goes blocking; that exact partial-tick nuance is inherent to a
// genuinely-blocking call and can't be preserved frame-for-frame in a
// non-blocking port regardless of where the check is placed, so this
// port uses the same simple, already-proven "check first, return early"
// shape instead of inventing a new approximation).
//
// ---- gbRepeat(btn, 0) bug found and fixed in the shim itself ----
// Upstream's own ship thrust/hyperspace/rotate-left/rotate-right controls
// all call `gb.buttons.repeat(BTN_x, 0)`, clearly intending "true every
// single tick the button is held" (the standard idiom for a continuously-
// held action, and the only sensible reading for thrust/rotation in an
// Asteroids clone - real `Buttons::repeat()` treats period 0 the same as
// period 1: fire on every held frame, confirmed directly against the real
// `Buttons.cpp` source). This shim's own `gbRepeat(button, period)`
// (gamebuinoShim.c) used to return true only on the very FIRST tick a
// button was pressed whenever `period <= 0` - the opposite of a continuous
// repeat, and a real, if narrow, divergence from real hardware. Found via
// this exact file's own ship controls needing it; fixed centrally in
// gamebuinoShim.c (gbRepeat() now matches real hardware's own period<=1
// "fire every held frame" behavior exactly), so the call sites below use
// the real, literal `gbRepeat(BTN_x, 0)` upstream itself calls, not a
// worked-around substitute.
//
// ---- Boolean-arithmetic idiom -> asterB() helper ----
// Upstream leans heavily on C's classic "multiply a numeric formula by a
// boolean condition" idiom instead of a real if/else or ternary (e.g.
// `left = 8 + 16*(asterocktype[i]>3) + 8*(asterocktype[i]>7);`,
// `score = score + 200 + 800*(ufotype==2);`). This dialect has no
// ternary operator, and no other ported game in this codebase was found
// using a raw `bool` operand directly inside int arithmetic (`int *
// bool`) to confirm it type-checks here, so rather than risk a compile
// failure this port added a tiny local `asterB(bool)` helper (returns
// 1/0) and wrapped every such condition in it - a mechanical, minimal-
// diff, dialect-safe stand-in for the exact same formulas, not a
// behavior change.
//
// ---- Two real bugs found, and fixed (not preserved) - both are genuine
// memory-safety hazards, not the harmless logic/visibility quirks this
// project otherwise preserves by default (compare gameAgaruino.c's own
// header comment, which preserves a similar-looking but harmless
// upstream oddity) ----
// 1. `newlevel()`'s own `asterocksonscreen = 4 + gamelevel*2; if
//    (asterocksonscreen>64) asterocksonscreen=64;` clamps against 64, but
//    every parallel `asterock*[32]` array (position/speed/type) upstream
//    itself declares is only 32 elements long - so from gamelevel 14
//    onward (4+14*2=32) up through ~gamelevel 29, upstream's own real
//    source writes past the end of every one of those arrays, a genuine
//    buffer overflow that would corrupt real AVR SRAM too (upstream's
//    own bug, not introduced by this port). Fixed here by clamping
//    `asterRocksOnScreen` to `ASTER_MAX_ROCKS` (32, the real declared
//    array size) instead of upstream's own mismatched 64. On real
//    hardware this silently corrupts nearby global RAM; ported literally
//    to a shared-cartridge environment with many other games' own
//    globals living in the same flat address space, the exact same bug
//    could corrupt THEIR state too, not just this game's own - a real
//    cross-game safety concern distinct in kind from a cosmetic gameplay
//    oddity, and worth fixing rather than preserving.
// 2. `moveufo()` sets `ufotype=0` the instant the UFO drifts off the left/
//    right edge, then unconditionally draws `ufo[ufotype-1]` (i.e.
//    `ufo[-1]`) on that exact same tick, in upstream's own real source.
//    On real AVR hardware this reads one PROGMEM byte before the `ufo[]`
//    table in flash - a contained, read-only, merely-cosmetic glitch (one
//    frame of garbled UFO pixels). Ported literally, `asterUfoFrames[-1]`
//    would instead read whatever RAM word happens to sit immediately
//    before this array (most likely another live global, not a fixed
//    flash byte) and hand it to `gbDrawBitmap()` as a completely
//    unvalidated width/height - a real risk of a much larger out-of-
//    bounds read than upstream's own contained flash glitch, potentially
//    reading (and rendering "bytes" from) far outside this game's own
//    memory. Fixed by re-checking `asterUfoType != 0` immediately before
//    that specific draw call, skipping it for the one tick the UFO type
//    just became 0 - the UFO simply disappears a frame earlier than
//    upstream's own glitch-frame, with no other behavior change.
//
// ---- Minor, behavior-preserving cleanups (not upstream bugs) ----
// Upstream's own `i`/`u` loop-index variables are reused loosely as
// globals across many top-level functions (always reset to 0 immediately
// before use in every case) - made local to each function instead here,
// including dropping one genuinely vestigial `i=++i;` at the very end of
// handleplayership()'s own ship-visible block, which has no observable
// effect on real hardware either (every consumer of `i` resets it to 0
// before ever reading it again). `destroyed`/`left`/`right` (per-rock
// scratch globals inside handlerocks(), likewise always reset before
// each use) became locals inside that same loop body for the same
// reason. The `float x, y;` scratch pair handlerocks() uses for a rock's
// per-tick velocity offset are declared local `int` here instead - both
// operands are always exact integers in every real call (asterRockXSpeed/
// YSpeed are themselves plain ints), so upstream's own float storage was
// never anything but a superfluous type choice for this particular use.
//
// Every other real formula/constant is preserved exactly as upstream
// wrote it, including several odd-looking but genuine, harmless upstream
// quirks: `newlevel()`'s own initial rock speed uses `rockxadd[random(4)]`
// (only the first 4 of the 12-entry table) for X but `rockyadd[random(12)]`
// (the full table) for Y - an asymmetric initial-velocity distribution,
// not a typo worth normalizing; the position-wrap thresholds (664, 376,
// -56, -80, 384) are kept as upstream's own literal sub-pixel (`*8`
// fixed-point) tuning constants rather than re-derived from
// `LCDWIDTH*8`/`LCDHEIGHT*8` programmatically, since they don't actually
// match those exactly either (664 vs 84*8=672, 376 vs 48*8=384 - real,
// deliberately-tuned upstream slack, not rounding error).
//
// EEPROM PERSISTENCE ADDED, BEYOND REAL UPSTREAM - no `EEPROM.read()`/
// `EEPROM.write()` calls exist anywhere in this game's real source, so
// `asterHighScore` was originally genuine in-session-only state (reset
// every relaunch). Added directly on request once an audit found this
// game displays a real highscore that never survives a cartridge reboot:
// `gameAsterocks_init()` now loads it via `eeprom_read_word(0)`, with the
// same `==0xFFFF` fresh-EEPROM-cell reset check already established
// elsewhere in this project (see gameCrabator.c's/gameDescent.c's own
// identical check) rather than trusting a raw 65535 sentinel. Saved via
// `eeprom_write_word(0, asterHighScore)` at the exact point upstream's
// own `asterUpdateTitle()` already updates `asterHighScore` in memory -
// naturally a one-shot write per new high score, not a per-frame write,
// since the `>` guard becomes false again the instant the save happens.
