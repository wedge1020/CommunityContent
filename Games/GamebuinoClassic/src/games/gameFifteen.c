// Fifteen (Tnxec2, no license specified - github.com/Tnxec2/fifteen; the
// staged repo carries no LICENSE file of any kind, only a Readme.md, a
// .gitignore, the SD-card .HEX/.INF artifacts and the sketch itself -
// confirmed by listing the real directory directly, not assumed). The
// classic sliding-tile puzzle: numbered tiles in a square grid with one
// empty cell, pushed around with the D-pad until they read 1..N-1 in order
// with the gap last. Three real board sizes (3x3 "easy", 4x4 "normal",
// 5x5 "hard") picked from the game's own level screen, plus a real EEPROM
// save that survives a power cycle.
//
// This is a genuinely separate codebase from this cartridge's already
// shipped TAQUIN (RackhamLeNoir), which is the same puzzle concept written
// independently - different author, different board sizes, different
// shuffle/solvability handling, different save behavior. Both ship, the
// same way this cartridge ships two Snake games, two 2048 variants, two
// Asteroids clones and two Breakout clones.
//
// Source: one real Arduino sketch, `src/fifteen/fifteen.ino` (450 lines,
// no other tabs), read in full before porting.
//
// DIALECT REWRITES (this project's standing conventions): every real
// `gb.x.y(...)` call site becomes a plain `gbY(...)` call (this dialect has
// no classes/methods - see gamePong.c's own header comment); array
// declarations use this dialect's required `TYPE[N] name` order; upstream's
// own `Gamestate` struct (the persisted save record: an id string, the
// board and the board dimension) is flattened into named globals
// (`ftnStateBuffer`/`ftnDimension`), matching the same treatment
// gameGemgem.c/gameMasterKebab.c already use for an identical real
// `struct`-copied-to-EEPROM pattern. `random(0,n)` becomes `arand(n)`;
// `gb.pickRandomSeed()` becomes `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a documented no-op;
// `gb.battery.show = false` is dropped (a real-hardware-only battery
// indicator, same treatment as gamePong.c). Global naming prefix: `ftn`.
//
// FONT: upstream never calls `setFont()` or touches `fontSize`, so every
// string and tile number is drawn in real hardware's own default font3x5 at
// size 1 - which is exactly what `gbBegin()` selects, so no font call
// appears in this port either.
//
// BITMAP: the real 64x30 `logo` PROGMEM table was converted from Arduino
// `B01010101` binary literals to plain hex by a one-off script (this dialect
// has no binary-literal syntax), its value count checked against its own
// real `{64,30}` header first - 240 row bytes, exact. No art was redrawn or
// approximated.
//
// EEPROM SAVE (the real feature worth porting carefully): upstream persists
// a whole `Gamestate` record - an 18-byte id string, the 25-entry board as
// AVR 16-bit ints, and the 16-bit board dimension - by copying the struct
// byte-for-byte over `EEPROM.write(x, ((uint8_t*)&gameState)[x])`, 70 bytes
// in total, and validates it by reading the first 18 bytes back and
// `strcmp_P`-ing them against its own literal `"FIFTEEN GAMEBUINO"`. That id
// string IS this game's fresh-cell sentinel, and it is a sound one: a
// factory-erased AVR EEPROM (and this project's own eepromShim.c, which
// deliberately matches that) reads 0xFF in every cell, mismatching the id's
// first character immediately, so `isValidGame()` correctly reports "no save
// here" and the game offers only a fresh start. Ported exactly, with the
// struct's implicit byte layout written out as explicit named addresses
// (FTN_EEP_ID / _BUFFER / _DIMENSION) instead of a `sizeof`-driven raw
// struct copy: this dialect's `sizeof` counts 32-bit words rather than
// bytes, and one conceptual AVR EEPROM byte address is one eepromShim cell,
// so a literal `((uint8_t*)&struct)[x]` copy would not mean the same thing
// here (see eepromShim.h's own header comment on that one-cell-per-byte
// model). The footprint is the same 70 cells upstream uses, well inside this
// shim's real 1024-cell ATmega328 address space. `eeprom_update_byte()` is
// used rather than `eeprom_write_byte()`: semantically identical (it only
// skips a write whose value is already stored) but it avoids re-running
// eepromShim.c's full-slot checksum for cells that never change after the
// first stamp - the whole 18-cell id string in particular. The resulting
// card contents are what upstream's own `EEPROM.write()` loop produces.
// The board/dimension cells are recomposed on load through `ftnNarrowS16()`,
// re-applying real AVR's own signed-16-bit narrowing that this dialect's
// always-32-bit `int` would otherwise skip (the same explicit-narrowing
// idiom gameGemgem.c/gameUnderTheTower.c already use). In practice every
// stored value here is 0..24, and the fresh-cell case can never reach this
// path at all because the id check gates it - the helper is correctness
// insurance, not a live fix.
//
// The two real save sites are ported unchanged: `newSave()` (a fresh
// zeroed record with dimension 3, stamped when "New Game" is chosen) and
// `saveGame()` (Button C during play).
//
// BLOCKING CALLS -> EXPLICIT STATES (matching gamePong.c's worked "blocking
// loop -> explicit resumable state" pattern used throughout this project):
// upstream has three blocking constructs - `gb.titleScreen(logo)`,
// `gameMenu()`'s own `while(1) { if (gb.update()) {...} }` load/new menu,
// and `chooseMap()`'s identical loop. All three become explicit states
// (FTN_STATE_TITLE / _MENU / _CHOOSEMAP / _PLAY). Upstream's real call
// graph is `titleMenu(init)` -> title screen, then `gameMenu()` when
// `init` is true or `chooseMap()` when it is false, and both of those can
// themselves call `titleMenu(false)` again - so which state follows the
// title screen, and which follows the level picker, are carried by
// `ftnAfterTitle`/`ftnAfterChooseMap`, reproducing all four real call
// sites exactly:
//   * `setup()`'s own `titleMenu(true)`      -> title, then the menu.
//   * the menu's own "New Game" choice       -> newSave(), then the level
//     picker, then play.
//   * play's own Button C handler,
//     `saveGame(); titleMenu(false);`        -> title, level picker, play.
//   * the menu's own Button B/C "exit",
//     `titleMenu(false);`                    -> title, level picker, and
//     then BACK INTO THE MENU, because upstream's own `while(1)` menu loop
//     simply resumes after that call returns. A genuinely odd real
//     behavior - "exit" from the menu walks you through the level picker,
//     initializes a board you then cannot see, and drops you back in the
//     same menu - preserved exactly rather than tidied into a quit, since
//     it is what real hardware does. Note the menu's own selection
//     highlight is a function-local in upstream that survives that round
//     trip, so `ftnMenuNewGame` is likewise only reset in
//     gameFifteen_init(), not on re-entering the menu state.
// The real `Gamebuino::titleScreen(logo)` layout lives inside the closed
// library, not in this game's sources, so that state is the same
// approximation every other port here uses: the real logo bitmap centered,
// plus an added "PRESS A" hint, dismissed by a genuine fresh
// `gbPressed(BTN_A)`.
//
// A SINGLE BLANK TICK ON STATE CHANGE: pressing C during play switches
// state and returns without drawing, so that one 50ms tick renders blank
// before the title paints. The same shape gameTaquin.c's Button-C pause and
// gameGemgem.c's own state switches already ship with - this project's
// established precedent, not a defect specific to this file.
//
// POPUPS: upstream uses two independent popup mechanisms and this port keeps
// both, because they genuinely look different on real hardware. The sketch
// defines its own local `popup()`/`updatePopup()` pair drawn at the TOP of
// the screen (used for "New Game" and "You won!"), while `saveGame()` and
// the menu's own "Game restored" use the real library's `gb.popup()`, which
// slides in from the BOTTOM (this shim's `gbPopup()`, drawn automatically by
// gbRenderFrame()). The local one is ported as `ftnPopup()`/
// `ftnUpdatePopup()`, called from exactly the place in the draw order
// upstream calls it (last, on top of the board).
//
// PRESERVED REAL UPSTREAM QUIRKS (kept as shipped, not fixed - this
// project's default):
//
// 1) `isSolvable()` does not implement the real 15-puzzle solvability rule.
//    It counts inversions over indices 0..gridSize-2 only (the last cell is
//    never examined) and treats the empty cell as an ordinary value 0
//    rather than excluding it, and it ignores the blank's own row entirely
//    (which the real parity rule needs for even-width boards). So the
//    "swap the first two tiles to make it solvable" correction it applies
//    is computed from the wrong parity and a deal can genuinely come out
//    unsolvable. Preserved verbatim: it is this game's real, shipped
//    shuffle behavior, and Button B reshuffles at any time, so an
//    unsolvable deal is never a dead end.
// 2) The local popup's own `uint8_t yOffset = popupTimeLeft - 12;` for its
//    last 12 ticks underflows a real AVR `uint8_t` to 244..255, so the box
//    is drawn far below the 48px screen and is simply invisible for that
//    whole tail - it does NOT slide anywhere, despite the arithmetic
//    clearly having been written expecting a signed slide. This dialect's
//    `int` never narrows, so the wrap is re-applied explicitly with `& 255`
//    (see ftnUpdatePopup()) to reproduce real hardware's invisible tail
//    rather than an upward slide that never happens on a real Gamebuino.
// 3) The "You won!" popup is re-armed on every single tick while the board
//    is solved, so it never expires and never fades - it just sits at the
//    top of the screen until the player starts a new game. Preserved.
// 4) `chooseMap()`'s two range clamps sit OUTSIDE their own `if
//    (gb.buttons.pressed(...))` bodies (upstream wrote the two-line
//    if/statement pairs without braces), so both clamps run on every tick
//    rather than only after a press. Harmless for the wrap-around they were
//    written for, and load-bearing in one real case: a dimension of 0 - the
//    struct's own zero-initialized starting value - is snapped straight to
//    5 by the unconditional `< SIZE_MIN` clamp on the picker's very first
//    tick, after that first tick has already drawn a level screen with no
//    name on it. Reproduced exactly, clamps outside the presses and all.
// 5) `saveGame()` returns early when the board is already solved, so
//    pressing C on a won board deliberately keeps whatever save was there
//    before. Preserved.
// 6) The menu's own "Load saved" choice with no valid save present does
//    nothing at all and still drops into play, on a board whose dimension
//    is still 0 - real hardware shows an empty bordered rectangle you
//    cannot move anything on (every direction is out of bounds against a
//    dimension of 0) until Button C or B is pressed. Preserved, with the
//    one Vircon32-specific guard described below.
//
// THE ONE REAL BEHAVIOR CHANGE, and why it is required here: quirk 6's
// zero dimension reaches `drawField()`'s own `LCDWIDTH / dimension` and
// `LCDHEIGHT / dimension`. Real AVR silently returns garbage from an
// integer division by zero and carries on; Vircon32 hard-traps the CPU
// (VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md section 17.3), which would crash the emulator
// outright the first time that reachable state occurs. `ftnDrawField()`
// therefore clamps the divisor to a minimum of 1. This is genuinely
// invisible: in that state the board is all zeros and the dimension is 0,
// so the grid-line loop (`i < dimension`) never runs and every tile print
// is skipped, leaving exactly the same lone border rectangle real hardware
// draws - only the crash is removed. Every other division by the dimension
// in this game (`findEmptyCell()`'s own `i / dimension` and `i % dimension`)
// is already unreachable at zero, because its loop bound is `gridSize`,
// which is always `dimension * dimension` at that point and therefore 0
// too; the same holds for `shuffle()`'s `arand(gridSize)`.
//
// SHIM GAPS: none found. Every primitive this port needs (gbDrawBitmap,
// gbDrawRect/gbFillRect/gbDrawLine, gbPrintString/gbPrintNumber, gbPressed,
// gbPlayOK, gbPopup, eeprom_read_byte/eeprom_update_byte, arand) already
// exists and is used directly. The only text this game prints that a plain
// string literal cannot hold is its icon glyphs - `F("\20")`/`F("\21")`,
// octal 020/021, i.e. ASCII 16/17, real Gamebuino low-ASCII glyphs rather
// than printable characters - built as explicit int arrays exactly like
// gameTaquin.c/gameSimonbuino.c/gameGemgem.c already do for the same gap.
