// FlappyBirdo (Forklift5 [Jerom, 2015, with help from Skyrunner65 and
// clement; SFX built with yodasvideoarcade's own "FX Synth" tool], License:
// None specified - github.com/Forklift5/FlappyBirdo). A real Flappy Bird
// clone for Gamebuino Classic: tap to flap a bird through a scrolling field
// of pipes, pick one of three difficulties (SLOW/NORMAL/FAST) from a menu
// first, each tracking its own in-session highscore.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why -
// this dialect has no classes/methods). `random(a,b)` became `a + arand(b-a)`
// (this dialect's own established RNG helper).
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED (this file's own earlier pass, before
// `gbDrawBitmap()` existed, dropped every upstream sprite in favor of
// plain-shape approximations - that pass's own writeup is gone now,
// superseded by this one). Every real `const byte NAME[] PROGMEM = {...}`
// array upstream (bird1Bitmap, bird2Bitmap, cityBitmap, pipeBitmap,
// skyBitmap, gameoverBitmap, trophyBitmap, titleBitmap) was copied
// byte-for-byte (via a small script reading the real .ino source directly
// and verified by re-decoding each array's own bits back into an ASCII
// preview before trusting it - not hand-transcribed) into a plain
// `int[N] flapXxxBitmap = { width, height, byte0, byte1, ... }` array
// below (this dialect's own `int[N] name` array-declaration order, not
// C's `int name[N]` - see gameConduit.c's own tile arrays for the same
// established precedent), exactly the format `gbDrawBitmap()`/
// `gbDrawBitmapRotated()` expect - no conversion needed, confirmed
// already valid in this dialect.
// Every real `gb.display.drawBitmap(...)` call site now has a direct
// `gbDrawBitmap()`/`gbDrawBitmapRotated()` counterpart at upstream's own
// exact real coordinates:
//   - bird1Bitmap/bird2Bitmap (the player) -> flapDrawPlayerAlive()
//     alternates them exactly like upstream's own drawPlayerAlive() (bird1
//     when animation>2, else bird2); flapDrawPlayerEnd() draws bird1Bitmap
//     ROTCW (rotation=3, matching upstream's own real
//     `drawBitmap(...,bird1Bitmap,ROTCW,NOFLIP)` call in drawPlayerEnd()).
//     A SECOND small real call site restored as a bonus (not originally
//     asked for, but a genuine `drawBitmap(bird1/2Bitmap,...)` call in
//     upstream's own Menu.ino): the difficulty menu's own tiny animated
//     bird "cursor" icon next to the selected line, in flapUpdateMenu().
//   - pipeBitmap -> flapDrawPipes() draws real upstream's own full 3-layer
//     pipe exactly: a GRAY body fill, then WHITE highlight strips (a 1px
//     line plus a 2px vertical strip near each pipe's own gap-facing
//     opening edge), then the BLACK outline bitmap on top (drawn directly
//     for the bottom pipe, via `gbDrawBitmapRotated(...,NOROT,FLIPV)` for
//     the top pipe) - matching upstream's own real `setColor(GRAY);
//     fillRect(...); setColor(WHITE); fillRect(...); setColor(BLACK);
//     drawBitmap(pipe[a].x, ..., pipeBitmap, NOROT, FLIPV);` sequence
//     exactly.
//   - cityBitmap/skyBitmap (the tiled background) -> flapDrawBackground()
//     draws a real GRAY top-of-sky band first, then tiles skyMaskBitmap
//     (WHITE, punching a cloud-shaped hole through the gray band),
//     skyBitmap (BLACK outline), and cityBitmap (GRAY silhouette) across
//     the real 84px-wide screen every 16px (upstream's own real per-tile
//     anchor, `(i*16, 13)` for clouds/`(i*16, 23)` for city - its own loop
//     bound of `256/16` iterations was itself sized for a wider reference
//     screen than this real 84px one, so it was scaled down here to
//     `i < LCDWIDTH` - same 16px stride, just fewer tiles, enough to cover
//     the real screen with one tile of clipped overhang past the right
//     edge exactly like upstream's own excess tiles did).
//   - the ground's own dithered/highlighted strip -> no bitmap involved at
//     all upstream either (checked Background.ino's own real drawGround()
//     directly) - flapDrawGround() draws the same real 4-layer
//     fillRect() sequence (BLACK top line, GRAY body, WHITE highlight
//     line, BLACK bottom shadow line) plus the real BLACK "dent" rects,
//     matching upstream exactly.
//   - gameoverBitmap/trophyBitmap -> flapUpdateGameover()/flapUpdateWin()
//     draw them directly at upstream's own real GAMEOVERX/TROPHYX x
//     coordinates (`floor((LCDWIDTH-30)/2)`=27 and `floor((LCDWIDTH-22)/2)`
//     =31 respectively - TROPHYX kept literal even though the real
//     trophyBitmap's own width is actually 24, not 22, an upstream
//     approximation of its own, not a porting artifact) and the same
//     sliding/floating Y upstream already used.
//   - titleBitmap (the logo shown by the very first `gb.titleScreen()`
//     call) -> flapUpdateTitle() now draws it directly via `gbDrawBitmap()`
//     at (0, 12) - the real anchor the actual `Gamebuino::titleScreen()`
//     function itself draws a passed-in logo at (confirmed by reading a
//     real full `Gamebuino.cpp`'s own `titleScreen()` body, since this
//     particular upstream source calls the library function rather than
//     drawing the logo inline itself) - replacing the previous "FLAPPY"/
//     "BIRDO" text-line stand-in. The "PRESS A" prompt text stays (that's
//     this port's own real UI text, not a sprite substitute), moved above
//     the bitmap instead of overlapping it.
//
// MASKS: every real `*MaskBitmap` array (upstream drew each one first in
// WHITE, immediately before drawing the real BLACK outline bitmap on the
// exact same spot) was ORIGINALLY skipped entirely on this file's first
// bitmap-restoration pass, on the assumption that "off" bits being fully
// transparent would already look identical to the real masked result -
// that assumption was wrong, caught via two separate real user reports
// (a pipe showing background bleeding through its own "white" interior,
// then the same thing for the bird) after this file had already shipped
// with it. Corrected per-sprite, case by case:
//   - bird1Bitmap/bird2Bitmap: **real bird1MaskBitmap/bird2MaskBitmap are
//     now genuinely restored and drawn** (flapDrawPlayerAlive()/
//     flapDrawPlayerEnd()) - a first attempt at fixing this with a plain
//     rectangular `gbFillRect()` (matching the pipe's own fix, below) was
//     itself wrong for a *different* reason: the bird's silhouette is
//     rounded, not rectangular, so a rectangle mask left a visibly
//     rectangular "halo" around it - restoring the real, bird-shaped mask
//     bytes was the only fix that actually looked right.
//   - pipeBitmap: has no real mask bitmap of its own upstream at all -
//     real hardware instead draws a real GRAY `fillRect()` body plus WHITE
//     highlight strips before the BLACK outline bitmap (see
//     flapDrawPipes() below) - a plain rectangle is correct here (not a
//     halo-prone approximation like the bird) since the real pipe body
//     genuinely is a rectangle on real hardware too, not a mask-shaped
//     silhouette.
//   - gameoverBitmap/trophyBitmap: same plain-`gbFillRect()` treatment as
//     the pipe (drawn on top of a busy already-drawn scene, where the real
//     mask mattered) - both are genuinely rectangular banner/cup shapes on
//     real hardware too, so no halo risk here either.
//   - skyMaskBitmap: real upstream's own genuine cloud-shaped WHITE mask,
//     restored as `flapSkyMaskBitmap` and drawn immediately before
//     `flapSkyBitmap` in `flapDrawBackground()`, punching a hole through
//     the real GRAY top-of-sky band exactly like upstream.
//
// STATE MACHINE: upstream's own two blocking `gb.titleScreen(...)` calls
// (a logo screen, then a text instructions screen, both inside
// `initGame()`) plus its own separately-interactive difficulty menu
// (`initDifficulty()`, gated by a `difficulty_menu` bool checked every
// `loop()` iteration) were converted into an explicit FlapState enum
// (FLAP_STATE_TITLE -> FLAP_STATE_MENU -> FLAP_STATE_PLAY), matching the
// "blocking loop -> explicit resumable state" treatment used throughout
// this project (see gamePong.c's own header comment). Upstream's own
// `player_death` bool (checked inline inside the main play branch) and its
// score>=SCOREMAX "win" branch became two further explicit states,
// FLAP_STATE_GAMEOVER and FLAP_STATE_WIN, each mirroring upstream's own
// `gameOver()`/`gameWin()` functions almost line for line. Every state
// re-entered via `flapBeginTitle()` (a fresh C-button press mid-game, or a
// completed win-animation cycle) performs the exact same full reset
// upstream's own `initGame()` does every time it runs: difficulty resets
// to NORMAL and the mute toggle resets to unmuted, discarding whatever the
// player had previously chosen - preserved here exactly since that really
// is what pressing C does on real hardware, not a porting artifact.
//
// SOUND: a direct, byte-for-byte port of upstream's own real "FX Synth"
// `soundfx[5][8]` table and its own real `playsoundfx(fxno,channel)` -
// `flapPlaySfx()` calls the shim's own real tracker-engine primitives
// (`gbSoundCommand()` for volume/instrument/slide/arpeggio,
// `gbPlayNoteChannel()` for the note itself), matching upstream's own
// exact call order/argument shape one-for-one. All 6 real call sites
// (Player.ino's own fly/death, Score.ino's own +1 point, End.ino's own
// win melody, Menu.ino's own two menu-bip presses) are restored with
// upstream's own exact fxno/channel arguments (channel always 0,
// matching upstream). Upstream's own mute toggle (`gb.sound.setVolume(
// sound_volume, 0)`, checked every tick) has no direct equivalent (no
// `gbSetVolume()` in this shim) - reimplemented instead by gating
// `flapPlaySfx()` itself on a `flapSoundOn` bool, which the B button
// still toggles exactly like upstream's own `soundMute()`.
//
// A GENUINE UPSTREAM BUG, FOUND, INITIALLY PRESERVED, THEN FIXED ON REQUEST:
// upstream's own `difficulty_level` is declared `long` ("easy=0.5 <
// normal=1.0 < hard=2.0" per its own comment) but the menu's own confirm
// handler does `if (difficulty_level == 0) difficulty_level = 0.5;` -
// assigning a fractional value to an integer-typed variable truncates it
// straight back to 0 on real hardware too, so selecting SLOW never actually
// gave a 0.5x speed at all: the pipes' own `pipe[z].x -= difficulty_level;`
// update became a no-op, and since the player never moves horizontally
// either, SLOW genuinely never scrolled a single pipe into range - the only
// way to "lose" on it was hitting the ground or ceiling. This port first
// kept that behavior verbatim (it read as a real, if surely unintended,
// quirk of original gameplay rather than a porting artifact), but was then
// asked directly to make SLOW's pipes actually move - unlike real
// hardware's own `long`, this dialect's `float` has no trouble holding a
// genuine `0.5`, so `flapDifficultySpeed` (used in real float arithmetic
// throughout `flapUpdatePipes()`) was changed from `int` to `float` and
// SLOW now resolves to a real `0.5` in `flapBeginPlay()` - the speed
// upstream's own comment clearly intended, not the truncated value its own
// `long` variable actually produced.
//
// DROPPED AS DEAD CODE UPSTREAM: `highscore_1`/`highscore_2`/`highscore_3`
// (plain `byte` globals, declared but never actually read or written
// anywhere in the real source - the actual highscore storage upstream
// uses is `pipe[0..2].hs`, itself never written to any persistent storage
// either) were not ported at all. This port's own equivalent
// (`flapHighscore[3]`) was likewise originally in-RAM/session-only,
// matching real upstream behavior exactly.
//
// EEPROM PERSISTENCE ADDED, BEYOND REAL UPSTREAM - added directly on
// request once an audit found this game displays 3 real per-difficulty
// highscores that never survived a cartridge reboot (real upstream never
// persisted them either, per the paragraph above - this is a genuine
// enhancement past real hardware, not a restoration). `gameFlappyBirdo_
// init()`'s own 3 real `flapHighscore[i] = 0;` lines are now 3 real
// `eeprom_read_word(i*2)` loads instead (2 bytes/entry, matching this
// project's own established per-entry layout, e.g. gameCrabator.c/
// gameDescent.c - with the same `==0xFFFF` fresh-EEPROM-cell reset check
// rather than trusting a raw 65535 sentinel) - the very same effective
// "0 on a genuinely fresh card" outcome the old hardcoded `=0` produced,
// just no longer discarding a real earlier save. Saved via
// `eeprom_write_word(flapDifficultyIndex*2, flapScore)` at the exact
// point this port's own highscore-tracking line already updates
// `flapHighscore[flapDifficultyIndex]` in memory - a one-shot write per
// new high score, not a per-frame write.
//
// A SECOND PRESERVED UPSTREAM QUIRK: upstream's own `loop()` always calls
// both `playerMove()` and `updatePipes()` together, and always draws
// `drawPlayerAlive()` right after, based on whether `player_death` was
// false *at the start* of that same tick - even on the exact tick a
// collision is detected inside `playerMove()` itself (which sets
// `player_death = true` only for the *next* tick's branch to notice).
// The practical effect is one extra "still alive" frame drawn on the same
// tick a fatal collision registers, before the death animation begins.
// Reproduced exactly below in `flapUpdateActive()`'s own FLAP_STATE_PLAY
// branch (checked once per tick, not re-checked after `flapPlayerMove()`
// runs).
//
// A PREVIOUSLY "REINTERPRETED" LINE, NOW RESOLVED FOR REAL: `drawPlayerEnd()`'s
// own `if (...) player_y += 4;` is captioned "the image move to the top" in
// upstream's own comment, even though a plain `+=` on a top-down Y axis
// normally moves a sprite *down* - this file's earlier pass (written before
// `gbDrawBitmapRotated()` existed) couldn't rule out the real hardware's own
// `ROTCW`-rotated `drawBitmap()` call changing what that Y offset anchors to,
// and guessed the comment's stated intent (float upward) over the literal
// arithmetic. Now actually checked against `gbDrawBitmapRotated()`'s own real,
// bit-for-bit-verified rotation math (see gamebuinoShim.c): rotation only
// remaps a bitmap's own internal pixel coordinates before adding the same x/y
// anchor - it never changes which screen direction a larger Y moves toward.
// So the literal arithmetic was right all along and the upstream comment was
// simply wrong (or referring to something else) - the dead bird's own corpse
// genuinely falls DOWN toward the ground (stopping just short of it), tumbling
// via the real `ROTCW` rotation on the way, in `flapDrawPlayerEnd()` below.
//
// `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became `gbPickRandomSeed()`, a documented no-op
// (see this project's own established precedent). `gb.battery`/backlight/
// tft calls: none exist in this particular upstream source to begin with.
// Real `font5x7`/`font3x5` (upstream switches between them per screen) were
// dropped like every other port here - this shim always renders with its
// own single fixed 8x8 glyph table at size 1 (see gamebuinoShim.h's own
// header comment); this game never needs size 2. Several menu/score text
// layouts were shortened or reflowed to fit this shim's own wider 8x8 font
// on the real 84px-wide display (the "PRESS A" prompt on the title screen,
// this port's own added UI text rather than a real upstream string, is
// positioned above the real titleBitmap logo rather than overlapping it).
//
// A REAL COLLISION-FIDELITY BUG, FOUND AND FIXED: bird-vs-pipe death
// detection used `gbCollideRectRect()` (an earlier, undocumented
// substitution - this shim had no `gbCollideBitmapBitmap()` primitive yet
// when this game was first ported), while real upstream's own
// `Player.ino` genuinely calls `gb.collideBitmapBitmap(PLAYERX, player_y,
// bird1Bitmap, pipe[cc].x, pipe[cc].y, pipeBitmap)` - real, per-pixel
// collision (confirmed directly against the real Gamebuino Classic
// library's own `Gamebuino::collideBitmapBitmap()` source, which
// genuinely does per-overlap-pixel testing, using `collideRectRect()`
// only as an early-exit bounding-box pre-check, not a replacement for it
// - see gameDescent.c's own `gbCollideBitmapBitmap()` for the same real
// source read). Restored to the real `gbCollideBitmapBitmap()` primitive
// (promoted to the shared shim later, once `gameDescent.c` needed it, but
// never backported to this file until now), matching upstream's own exact
// call shape - the bird's own real outline (not its full rectangular
// bounding box) now has to actually touch a pipe's own real solid pixels
// to die, exactly like real hardware.
