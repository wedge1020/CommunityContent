// ANOTHER 2048 (gameAnother2048.c) - same one-file sketch shape, same
// free-spinning-loop + millis()-debounce structure, same counter-based
// stand-in for an RNG, so several of the porting decisions below are
// deliberately identical to that file's own.
//
// THE REAL MECHANIC, as actually implemented (not as the name suggests):
// a fixed 3x3 grid of holes fills the left two thirds of the LCD, with a
// live score/level/lives readout down the right edge. A hammer cursor (a
// plain 12x13 outline rectangle, not a hammer sprite) is moved between the
// 9 holes with the D-pad and swung with Button A. Moles pop up one at a
// time, at a random hole, on a fixed timer:
//   - A spawn attempt happens every `moleNowMinTimeNextMole` ms (2500ms at
//     level 1). One random hole of the 9 is picked; if that hole is
//     already showing a mole, the attempt is simply skipped and nothing
//     spawns until the next one - so at most one new mole per interval,
//     and occasionally none.
//   - A spawned mole stays up for `moleMoleTimeoutTimeNow` ms (5000ms at
//     level 1) and then burrows away on its own, costing one life.
//   - Swinging at a hole that has a mole scores a point and clears it;
//     swinging at an empty hole costs one life.
//   - Every `moleScoreLevelUpNow` points (5 at first, then 5 + level/2)
//     the level goes up: the mole timeout drops 200ms per level (floor
//     500ms), the spawn interval drops 300ms per level (floor 300ms), and
//     the (dead - see below) max interval drops 100ms per level (floor
//     500ms). So the game gets faster in both directions at once.
//   - The game starts with 11 lives; at 0 the mole logic freezes entirely
//     and a "Game Over" box is drawn over the frozen board.
// Upstream's own README describes slightly different numbers ("2.5 seconds
// at the beginning", "10 lives at the beginning") than its own code
// actually implements (5000ms, 11 lives) - the code is what is ported here.
//
// Every real `gB.x.y(...)` call site is mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (this dialect has no classes/methods - see
// gamePong.c's own header comment for the full reasoning). `int8_t`/
// `int16_t`/`int32_t`/`uint8_t`/`uint16_t`/`uint32_t`/`long` all became
// plain `int` (avrCompat.h aliasing - this dialect has exactly one 32-bit
// integer width; see the one place below where that difference is
// deliberately undone). Upstream's own `int16_t(...)` C++ functional cast
// became a plain `(int)` cast. The seven `#define BTN_*_PIN`/`#define
// SCR_*` pin constants and `#define BuzzerPin` at the top of the real
// sketch are dropped: they are real hardware pin numbers, never referenced
// anywhere in the sketch's own code (and each is written with a stray
// trailing semicolon inside the macro body upstream, so they could not have
// been used in an expression even if something had tried) - the identical
// situation gameAnother2048.c's own header comment documents for this same
// author's other sketch. `gb.pickRandomSeed()` became `gbPickRandomSeed()`,
// a documented no-op; `gb.battery.show = false;` was dropped outright
// (purely cosmetic on real hardware, no equivalent exists or is needed
// here); `delay(200)` (a real blocking boot/restart pause with no gameplay
// effect of its own) was dropped too - all three matching every other port
// in this project.
//
// millis() -> A VIRTUAL 50ms-PER-TICK CLOCK: this game's whole design is
// millis()-driven (mole timeouts, spawn interval, input debounce), and
// Vircon32 has no wall-clock primitive to read (the same gap
// gameGemgem.c's/gameCatcher.c's/gameSnakeAbc.c's own header comments
// document). `moleMillis` stands in for it: upstream never calls
// `gb.setFrameRate()`, so it runs at real Gamebuino Classic's own 20fps
// default (50ms per tick, which this shim's own gbUpdate() throttle honors
// exactly), and `moleMillis` advances by exactly 50 on every real logic
// tick. Every one of upstream's own real millisecond constants is a whole
// multiple of 50 (5000/2500/500/300/200/100), so every deadline lands
// exactly on a tick with no rounding drift at all, and every upstream
// formula is kept literally in milliseconds rather than being rewritten
// into ticks. The clock keeps advancing during the title screen too,
// exactly like real millis() does while `gb.titleScreen()` blocks - which
// matters: see the restart bug below, and note that a player who lingers
// more than 5 seconds on the title screen gets a mole immediately on the
// first gameplay tick (upstream's own `level_timeNextMole` starts at the
// literal value 5000, i.e. an absolute deadline initialized from a
// duration - real hardware behaves the same way, since its millis() is
// already several seconds past 5000 by the time a player dismisses the
// blocking title screen).
//
// THE FREE-SPINNING loop() -> ONE PASS PER LOGIC TICK: upstream's input
// block, `checkTimoutMoles()`, `randGenMoles()` and `rand_counter++` all
// run on every single `loop()` iteration (thousands per second on real
// hardware), with only `drawGamePad()` gated behind `if(gb.update())`.
// Here the whole body runs once per real 20fps logic tick, in upstream's
// own textual order (input, then draw, then the timeout/spawn logic, so a
// mole that spawns on tick N first becomes visible on tick N+1 exactly like
// upstream). Two real consequences, both handled deliberately:
//   - The 200ms debounce still does real work and is kept literally
//     (`moleDebounceNextMillis = moleMillis + 200`): it locks the whole
//     input block out for 4 ticks after any accepted press, so the hammer
//     steps deliberately rather than sliding. (Note upstream's own
//     `#define debounceDelay 100` is never used anywhere - the real code
//     writes the literal 200 instead; the unused macro is dropped.) A press
//     that lands inside that window is lost here exactly as it is upstream,
//     where `gb.buttons.pressed()` only latches for one 50ms frame and so
//     has long expired by the time the 200ms lockout lifts.
//   - `rand_counter` is REPLACED WITH arand(), DELIBERATELY - the same
//     decision, for the same reason, as gameAnother2048.c's own (see that
//     file's own header comment). Upstream has no real RNG call anywhere:
//     it free-runs a plain counter (`rand_counter++` per loop iteration,
//     plus a scramble - `-= 5678`, `&= ~0x00000F0F`, `+= ~rand_counter`,
//     `|= 0x000000FF`, `+= 1234; = ~rand_counter`, `*= 3 + 1` - inside
//     each individual button branch) and samples `rand_counter % 9` at
//     spawn time to pick which hole gets the mole. On real hardware, with
//     many thousands of loop iterations between two spawns, that is
//     effectively uniform noise over the 9 holes, which is exactly what
//     the formula stands in for. Reproducing the counter literally here
//     would NOT reproduce it: this port's own loop runs at a fixed 20 ticks
//     per second and spawn attempts are always an exact whole number of
//     ticks apart (50 ticks at level 1), so `rand_counter % 9` would step
//     by a fixed amount every time and cycle through the 9 holes in a
//     fixed, fully predictable order for the entire session. So the
//     counter, all six of its per-button scrambles, and upstream's own
//     `positive_modulo()` helper (dead code - it exists only to keep that
//     counter non-negative and is never actually called anywhere in the
//     real sketch) are all dropped in favour of a single `arand( 9 )`,
//     which reproduces the real observable behavior (a uniformly random
//     hole) rather than the exact counter arithmetic. The one place this
//     needs care is that upstream evaluates `rand_counter % 9` TWICE in
//     `randGenMoles()` - once to test the hole and once to fill it - with
//     the counter unchanged in between, so both reads select the same
//     hole; `moleRandGenMoles()` below therefore samples arand() once into
//     a local and uses it for both, rather than rolling twice.
//
// A REAL DEAD "RANDOM INTERVAL" - THE SPAWN RATE IS NOT RANDOM AT ALL:
// upstream's own `randGenMoles()` computes `timeInterval = max - min` and
// `randTimeInterval = rand_counter % timeInterval`, then never uses
// `randTimeInterval` for anything - the line it looks like it was written
// for instead reads `level_timeNextMole = millis() + constrain(
// (level_nowMinTimeNextMole), level_nowMinTimeNextMole,
// level_nowMaxTimeNextMole)`, i.e. a `constrain()` of a value against
// itself as its own lower bound, which is provably just
// `level_nowMinTimeNextMole` unchanged. So every spawn attempt is exactly
// `min` milliseconds after the last one, with the whole min/max pair
// collapsing to "min" and `level_nowMaxTimeNextMole` only ever mattering
// via the `if(max < min) max = min` clamp in `setLevel()`. That real
// behavior (a fixed, non-random spawn interval) is preserved exactly;
// `moleRandGenMoles()` below just writes the already-reduced form with
// this note attached rather than carrying the `constrain()` call. The two
// genuinely dead lines are NOT carried over, deliberately: `rand_counter %
// timeInterval` is a modulo whose divisor is a runtime value that a
// sufficiently unlucky state could make zero, and a modulo by zero
// hard-traps the CPU on this platform where AVR silently yields garbage
// (VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md section 17.3) - there is no reason to carry a
// crash risk for a value provably nothing reads.
//
// THE BUTTON-C RESTART IS GENUINELY BROKEN UPSTREAM - PRESERVED, WITH REAL
// AVR NARROWING EMULATED ON PURPOSE: upstream's own restart branch resets
// score/level/lives correctly, but sets its three real timing variables to
// `<duration constant> + millis()` instead of the plain duration constant:
//     level_nowMinTimeNextMole   = 2500 + millis();
//     level_nowMaxTimeNextMole   = 5000 + millis();
//     level_moleTimeoutTimeNow   = 5000 + millis();
// All three are real `int16_t` on real hardware, so the sum narrows modulo
// 65536 into a signed 16-bit value. The result is a real, shipped bug with
// two distinct regimes: restart within the first ~30 seconds of a session
// and the values stay positive but enormous (a 12-second-plus gap between
// moles, moles that never time out); restart after that and they wrap
// NEGATIVE, so every spawn deadline and every mole's own timeout is
// already in the past the moment it is written - moles spawn every single
// tick and immediately expire, draining all 10 lives in well under a second
// and dropping straight back to "Game Over".
//   This port reproduces that, rather than either "fixing" it or letting
// this dialect's always-32-bit `int` silently change it. Leaving the
// narrowing out is NOT the neutral choice: a plain 32-bit `2500 + millis()`
// stays large and positive forever, which would make a restarted game sit
// completely inert with no moles at all for minutes - a behavior real
// hardware never has. So `moleNarrowS16()` below applies the real AVR
// truncation at exactly those three assignment sites (the same "emulate the
// real narrow-int wraparound the original depended on" treatment
// gameUnderTheTower.c's own `uttNarrowS8()` and gameDarkShmup.c's own
// `& 255`/`& 65535` masks already establish in this project). Note the
// resulting game-over-on-restart is not a soft-lock: this cartridge's own
// global Start-button quit-confirmation dialog returns to the shared menu
// from any state, and relaunching runs gameMoleControl_init() fresh - the
// exact equivalent of the power cycle a real Gamebuino owner would need,
// the same reasoning gameAnother2048.c's own preserved "no way back after
// winning" quirk already uses.
//
// TWO MORE REAL UPSTREAM QUIRKS, PRESERVED: the game starts with ELEVEN
// lives (`int8_t lifes = 11;`) but the Button-C restart resets to TEN -
// both values are upstream's own, kept exactly (upstream's own README
// documents only the 10). And `clickMole()`'s own miss branch writes
// `moleTimeoutMillis[...] = 0` on a hole that is already 0 by definition
// (it only reaches that branch because the hole was empty) - a harmless
// real no-op, carried over verbatim.
//
// TITLE SCREEN: upstream's own blocking `gb.titleScreen(F("Mole Control"),
// titleScreenImage)` - called once from setup(), and again (still blocking,
// mid-loop) whenever Button C is pressed to restart - is converted into an
// explicit MOLE_STATE_TITLE state dismissed by a genuine `gbPressed(BTN_A)`,
// the same "blocking widget -> explicit resumable state" treatment used
// throughout this project (see gamePong.c's own header comment). The real
// `Gamebuino::titleScreen()` library function draws its logo bitmap at a
// fixed (0,12) screen anchor - confirmed against the real Gamebuino.cpp
// source during gameFlappyBirdo.c's/gameUfoRace.c's/gameArmageddon.c's own
// ports of that same real function, and reused unchanged here. This game's
// own logo is 24x20, so at (0,12) it occupies y 12..31 and x 0..23 with
// zero clipping (left-aligned, exactly as real hardware draws it - not
// re-centered). The caption line is upstream's own real `initScreenText`
// string in upstream's own real `initScreenFont` (font5x7); the "PRESS A"
// prompt is this port's own added UI affordance, exactly as every other
// port restoring a real `titleScreen()` call has needed. No mole/timeout
// logic runs while the title is up, matching real hardware exactly (its own
// `loop()` is never entered while `titleScreen()` blocks) - only the
// millisecond clock keeps running, as described above.
//
// RESTART ORDERING PRESERVED: upstream's own Button C branch calls the
// blocking `titleScreen()` FIRST and only resets score/level/lives/timers
// afterward, once the title screen returns - so the old board is still in
// memory (though not on screen) for as long as the title is up, and, far
// more importantly, the `+ millis()` bug above samples the clock at the
// moment the title is DISMISSED, not at the moment C is pressed. Reproduced
// exactly via moleRestartPending: C enters MOLE_STATE_TITLE, and the whole
// reset runs at the moment Button A dismisses it.
//
// REAL BITMAP ART RESTORED: all three real upstream bitmaps - the 24x20
// `titleScreenImage` logo, the 16x10 `holeIcon` and the 16x10 `moleIcon` -
// are carried over byte-for-byte, with every `B00000000`-style Arduino
// binary literal converted to plain hex (this dialect has no such literal
// syntax) and each array's own body byte count verified against its own
// declared width/height header before being trusted (24 wide -> 3 bytes per
// row x 20 rows = 60; 16 wide -> 2 bytes per row x 10 rows = 20). Both
// icons declare a 16px width while only their leftmost 10 columns carry any
// content, which is upstream's own (the trailing columns are simply zero
// bits and draw nothing). Checked for the mask/fill-under-bitmap bug class
// found in gameFlappyBirdo.c/gameParachute.c: it does not apply - each of
// the three is drawn as a single self-contained sprite with no separate
// mask or fill layer anywhere in the real source, onto a framebuffer this
// shim's own gbUpdate() has already cleared, and a hole and a mole are
// mutually exclusive at any given grid cell so they never overlap.
//
// ONE PURE-PERFORMANCE REWRITE, OUTPUT PROVABLY IDENTICAL: upstream's own
// `drawGamePad()` builds the entire score/level/lives readout - 6 separate
// cursor-positioned prints - INSIDE its own 3x3 nested hole loop, so all
// six are drawn 9 times per frame at the exact same coordinates with the
// exact same values. On real hardware that is merely wasteful; here it is
// ~120,000 instructions of a ~250,000-instruction frame budget spent
// redrawing identical text (see VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md section 16 - every
// call costs a flat ~10+2*argcount instructions, and a font3x5 glyph is
// 24 per-pixel iterations). The readout is hoisted out of the loop below.
// The output is byte-for-byte identical, not merely similar: every draw
// this game makes is a transparent "on"-bits-only BLACK draw (upstream
// never calls `setColor()` at all outside its own game-over box, and
// gbSetColor(GB_BLACK) sets color and background alike, so nothing here
// ever paints a WHITE or opaque-background pixel), which makes every draw
// a pure OR into the framebuffer - so both the repetition and the relative
// order of the hole sprites and the text are provably irrelevant to the
// resulting pixels. The identical "hoist/gate the redundant call, not just
// the work inside it" lesson is documented project-wide in CLAUDE.md's own
// performance-pass section.
//
// SOUND: upstream has none at all - no `gb.sound.*` call anywhere in the
// real sketch (its `#define BuzzerPin 3;` is one of the unused,
// unusable-as-written pin macros described above). None was invented, so
// this port is silent exactly like the original.
//
// EEPROM: upstream has none - no `#include <EEPROM.h>`, no `EEPROM.read()`/
// `.write()` call anywhere in the real source (confirmed by direct grep),
// and no highscore concept of any kind: the score readout is a live,
// session-only counter that the Button-C restart zeroes. None was invented,
// matching this project's own "don't invent a highscore real upstream never
// had" precedent.
//
// NO SHIM GAPS: every primitive this port needs already exists
// (gbDrawBitmap, gbDrawRect, gbFillRect, gbPrintString/gbPrintNumber,
// gbSetFont with the real gbFont3x5/gbFont5x7 tables, gbSetColor with the
// real GB_GRAY dither, gbPressed, arand). Nothing in gamebuinoShim.h/.c or
// any other shared file was changed.

// Layout/tuning constants - upstream's own real #define values, verbatim
