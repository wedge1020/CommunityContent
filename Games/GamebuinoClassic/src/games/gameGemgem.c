// GemGem (Tnxec2, no license specified - github.com/Tnxec2/gemgem-gamebuino,
// the repo carries no LICENSE file of any kind, only a Readme.md; confirmed
// by listing the real repo contents directly, not assumed). A Bejeweled-
// style match-3: a 9x5 board of 7 gem types, a D-pad cursor, Button A marks
// a gem and then swaps it with an orthogonally adjacent marked neighbour.
// A swap that produces no run of three or more is undone automatically;
// runs are erased, the gems above fall into the gap, new gems drop in at
// the top row, and the whole erase/fall cycle repeats until the board is
// stable. 10 points per triplet plus 10 per extra gem in the run. The game
// ends when no single swap anywhere on the board could produce a match.
//
// Source: 4 real upstream `.ino` tabs sharing one real Arduino translation
// unit (`GEMGEM.ino`/`Process.ino`/`State.ino`/`PrintUtils.ino` - confirmed
// no other source files exist in the staged directory; the repo's own
// nested `gemgem-gamebuino/` subfolder is a byte-identical duplicate of its
// own parent, verified with a recursive diff, an upload artifact rather
// than a second variant, so it was ignored). All four read in full before
// porting.
//
// DIALECT REWRITES (this project's own standing conventions): every real
// `gb.x.y(...)` call site became a plain `gbY(...)` call (this dialect has
// no classes/methods - see gamePong.c's own header comment for the full
// reasoning); upstream's own `switch` statements (`nextstep()`'s own step
// dispatch, `drawField()`'s own gem-image selection) became if/else-if
// chains; every array declaration uses this dialect's own required
// `TYPE[N] name` order; upstream's own `coords` struct (a plain x/y pair,
// used for `cursor`/`marked`/`switched`/`hint`) was flattened into pairs of
// named `int` globals (`gemCursorX`/`gemCursorY`/...), and upstream's own
// `Gamestate` struct (the persisted save record) into named globals
// (`gemHighscore`/`gemScore`/`gemSavedBoard`), matching the same "flatten a
// struct into named globals" treatment gameMasterKebab.c's own port already
// established for an identical real `struct`-copied-to-EEPROM pattern. The
// ternary in `saveGame()` (`gameOver ? 0 : board[row][col]`) became an
// if/else (no ternary in this dialect). Global naming prefix: `gem`
// (checked clear of every other game shipped in this cartridge -
// game2048.c's own bare `g` prefix is a distinct identifier space, nothing
// there is named `gem*`).
//
// BITMAPS: the real `logo` (64x30) and `gem1`-`gem7` (8x7 each) PROGMEM
// tables were converted from Arduino `B01010101` binary literals to plain
// `0x` hex by a one-off script (this dialect has no binary-literal syntax),
// with every table's own value count verified against its own real
// `{width,height,...}` header before being pasted in - all 8 exact. No art
// was redrawn, approximated, or dropped.
//
// TIMING: upstream's own gem-cascade pacing is the one real `millis()`
// consumer (`process()`: `if (currentTime - prevTime >= delayTime)` with
// `delayTime = 200`). Vircon32 has no wall-clock primitive to read (the
// same gap gameCatcher.c's/gameSnakeAbc.c's own header comments already
// document), so it became a plain tick countdown: upstream never calls
// `gb.setFrameRate()` at all, so it runs at real Gamebuino Classic's own
// 20fps default (50ms per tick, and this shim's own gbUpdate() throttle
// honors that exactly), making 200ms exactly 4 ticks - no rounding.
// `startProcessing()`'s own real `prevTime = 0` (which makes the very
// first `process()` call step immediately, since any real `millis()`
// reading already exceeds the 200ms threshold against a zero baseline) is
// reproduced by arming the countdown at 0, so the first tick after a swap
// steps at once and every following step is a full 4 ticks later.
//
// EEPROM SAVE/PAUSE (the real feature this game is unusual for having, and
// the reason it was worth porting carefully): upstream persists a whole
// `Gamestate` record - a 20-byte id string, a 2-byte highscore, a 2-byte
// score and the full 45-cell board - by memcpy'ing the struct byte-by-byte
// over `EEPROM.write(x, ((uint8_t*)&gameState)[x])`, and validates it on
// boot by reading the first 20 bytes back and `strcmp_P`-ing them against
// its own literal `"GEMGEM GAMEBUINO V1"` id string. That id string IS this
// game's own fresh-cell sentinel, and it is a genuinely sound one: a real
// factory-erased AVR EEPROM (and this project's own eepromShim.c, which
// deliberately matches it) reads 0xFF in every cell, which mismatches the
// id's own first character immediately, so `isValidGame()` correctly
// reports "no save here" and `newSave()` stamps a fresh zeroed record.
// Ported exactly, just with the struct's own implicit byte layout written
// out as explicit named addresses (`GEM_EEP_ID`/`_HIGHSCORE`/`_SCORE`/
// `_BOARD`) instead of relying on a `sizeof`-driven raw struct copy - this
// dialect's `sizeof` counts 32-bit words, not bytes, and one conceptual AVR
// EEPROM byte address is one eepromShim cell, so a literal
// `((uint8_t*)&struct)[x]` copy would not mean the same thing here (see
// eepromShim.h's own header comment on that one-cell-per-byte model). The
// total footprint is the same 69 cells upstream uses, well inside this
// shim's own real 1024-cell ATmega328 address space. Three real save sites,
// all ported: `newSave()` (fresh stamp when validation fails),
// `saveGame()` (Button C during play - saves board+score+highscore, or a
// zeroed board if the game is already over), and `saveNewHighScore()` (on
// game over with a new best - persists the highscore and deliberately
// zeroes the saved board, upstream's own way of retiring a finished game).
// `eeprom_update_byte()` is used rather than `eeprom_write_byte()`: it is
// semantically identical (it only skips a write whose value is already
// there) but avoids re-running eepromShim.c's own full-slot checksum for
// every one of the 69 cells on every save, most of which - the whole 20-cell
// id string in particular - never change after the first stamp. Purely a
// Vircon32 write-cost consideration; the resulting card contents are
// byte-for-byte what upstream's own `EEPROM.write()` loop produces.
//
// REAL AVR NARROW-INT ROUND-TRIP: the persisted highscore/score are real
// signed 16-bit AVR `int`s stored as two bytes each. This dialect's `int`
// is always 32-bit and never narrows, so `gemNarrowS16()` re-applies the
// real narrowing when loading (the same explicit-narrowing helper idiom
// gameUnderTheTower.c's own `uttNarrowS8()` already established) - keeping
// the load path's own arithmetic identical to real hardware's rather than
// silently widening a value real hardware would have wrapped. In practice
// no reachable score gets anywhere near 32767 (10 points per match), and
// the fresh-cell 65535 case can never reach this path at all, since the id
// check gates it - the helper is correctness insurance, not a live fix.
//
// BLOCKING CALLS -> EXPLICIT STATES (matching gamePong.c's own worked
// "blocking loop -> explicit resumable state" pattern used throughout this
// project): upstream has two blocking constructs, `gb.titleScreen(...)` and
// `gameMenu()`'s own `while(1) { if (gb.update()) {...} }` new-game/load
// menu. Both became explicit states (`GEM_STATE_TITLE`/`GEM_STATE_MENU`/
// `GEM_STATE_PLAY`). `titleMenu(firstRun)`'s own two real behaviors are
// carried by `gemTitleReturn`, reproducing all three real call sites
// exactly:
//   * `setup()`'s own `titleMenu(true)`   -> title, then the menu
//     (GEM_TITLE_TO_MENU).
//   * `loop()`'s own Button-C handler, `saveGame(); titleMenu(false);`
//     -> title, then `initGame()`, then straight into play
//     (GEM_TITLE_TO_PLAY). Note this really does start a brand new game
//     after saving, not resume the saved one - upstream's own behavior,
//     preserved.
//   * `gameMenu()`'s own Button-B/C handler, `titleMenu(false);`
//     -> title, then `initGame()`, then back into the menu it was called
//     from, because upstream's own `while(1)` menu loop simply resumes
//     after that call returns (GEM_TITLE_TO_MENU_AFTER_INIT). A genuinely
//     odd real behavior - "exit" from the menu initializes a game you then
//     cannot see, and leaves you in the same menu - preserved exactly
//     rather than tidied into a quit, since it is what real hardware does.
// The real `Gamebuino::titleScreen(text, logo)` layout lives inside the
// closed library, not in this game's own sources, so this state's own
// screen is the same approximation every other port here uses (the real
// logo bitmap, the real caption text, and an added "PRESS A" hint),
// dismissed by a genuine fresh `gbPressed(BTN_A)`.
//
// A SINGLE BLANK TICK ON STATE CHANGE: switching state mid-tick (Button C
// during play, or dismissing the title) returns without drawing, so that
// one 50ms tick renders blank before the destination state paints. Exactly
// the same shape gameTaquin.c's own Button-C pause already ships with -
// this project's established precedent, not a defect specific to this file.
//
// POPUPS: upstream has TWO independent popup mechanisms and this port keeps
// both, because they genuinely look different on real hardware.
// `PrintUtils.ino` defines a local `popup()`/`updatePopup()` pair drawn at
// the TOP of the screen (used for "New game"/"Game restored" from the
// menu), while `saveGame()` calls the real library's own `gb.popup()`,
// which slides in from the BOTTOM (this shim's own `gbPopup()`, drawn
// automatically by gbRenderFrame()). The local one is ported as
// `gemPopup()`/`gemUpdatePopup()`, called from exactly the same place in
// the draw order upstream calls it (after the cursor, before the pause /
// game-over dialogs, so those still cover it).
//
// PRESERVED REAL UPSTREAM QUIRKS (kept as shipped, not fixed - this
// project's own default):
//
// 1) The local popup's own `uint8_t yOffset = popupTimeLeft - 12;` for its
//    last 12 ticks underflows a real AVR `uint8_t` to 244..255, so the box
//    is drawn far below the 48px screen and is simply invisible for that
//    whole tail - it does NOT slide anywhere, despite the arithmetic
//    clearly having been written expecting a signed slide-up. This
//    dialect's `int` never narrows, so the wrap is re-applied explicitly
//    with `& 255` (see gemUpdatePopup()) to reproduce real hardware's own
//    invisible tail rather than an upward slide that never happens on a
//    real Gamebuino.
// 2) `restoreGame()` ("Load saved") calls `initVars()` but never resets the
//    score, so restoring a save keeps whatever score the record carries -
//    including after `saveNewHighScore()` deliberately zeroed the saved
//    board, in which case "Load saved" deals a fresh random board while
//    keeping the previous run's final score. Preserved.
// 3) `canMakeMove()` sets `showHint = false` the moment it finds any
//    playable move (upstream even flags it `// TODO - set to false for
//    production`), so the hint coordinates it just computed are hidden
//    again immediately; only Button B (pause) turns the readout back on.
//    Preserved verbatim.
// 4) `eraseGems()` scores per matched origin cell using a `count` that
//    starts at 1 and is incremented only for cells not already marked, so
//    an intersecting horizontal+vertical run can score its shared gems
//    differently depending on scan order, and a single erase pass can award
//    several overlapping bonuses. Ported line-for-line rather than
//    normalized - it is this game's own real scoring behavior.
// 5) `drawField()` relies on the display color still being BLACK from the
//    previous tick when it draws the top score bar (it never sets a color
//    before that first `fillRect`). True on real hardware and true here (a
//    tick always ends with BLACK selected), so no color call was inserted
//    that upstream does not have.
//
// DROPPED: `gb.battery.show = false` (real-hardware-only battery indicator,
// same treatment as gamePong.c). `gb.pickRandomSeed()` -> `gbPickRandomSeed()`,
// a documented no-op. Every `random(1, NUMGEMIMAGES+1)` became
// `1 + arand(GEM_NUMGEMIMAGES)` (this project's own established RNG
// conversion). Sound is upstream's own two real one-shot calls
// (`playOK()`/`playCancel()`), which this shim implements directly - no
// approximation was needed for this game at all.
//
// SHIM GAPS: none found. Every primitive this port needs (gbDrawBitmap,
// gbFillRect/gbDrawRect/gbDrawFastHLine/gbDrawFastVLine/gbDrawPixel,
// gbPrintString/gbPrintNumber, gbPressed, gbPlayOK/gbPlayCancel, gbPopup,
// eeprom_read_byte/eeprom_update_byte, arand, itoa/strlen) already exists.
// The only text this game prints that a plain string literal cannot hold is
// the menu's own `F("\20")` selection cursor (octal 020 = ASCII 16, one of
// real Gamebuino's own custom low-ASCII icon glyphs), built as an explicit
// int array exactly like gameTaquin.c's/gameSimonbuino.c's own header
// comments already established for the same real gap.
