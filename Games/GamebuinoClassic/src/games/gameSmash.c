// Smash-and-Crash (Skyrunner65, license: none specified -
// github.com/Skyrunner65/Smash-and-Crash). An Arkanoid-named but actually
// endless-survival platformer: a small robot stands on a fixed arrangement
// of platforms (one of 4 selectable maps) while one of four randomly
// rotating "disasters" (falling meteor / homing-ish arrow / bouncing ball /
// a stationary black hole) threatens it every ~200 frames; move left/right,
// jump, hold B while moving to run faster, survive as long as possible -
// touching a hazard, falling off the bottom, or landing wrong all end the
// round, with the survived frame count as the score.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why -
// this dialect has no classes/methods). Every upstream global/function got
// a `smash`-prefixed name (checked against every other prefix already in
// use in this cartridge before picking it - not taken). `boolean` became
// `bool`. `random(N)`/`random(min,max)` became `arand(N)`/`min + arand(max
// - min)` (this project's own established RNG helper).
//
// TWO REAL BLOCKING-WIDGET CALLS, NEITHER WITH A SHIM EQUIVALENT, BOTH
// CONVERTED TO EXPLICIT STATES (matching gamePong.c's own "blocking call ->
// resumable state" treatment, and gameCrazyCar.c's own precedent for
// exactly this situation):
//   1. `gb.titleScreen(F(" "), Title)` -> SMASH_STATE_TITLE. Real
//      `Gamebuino::titleScreen()` prints the passed name at cursor (0,12)
//      then draws the passed logo at `(0, 12+logoOffset)`, where
//      `logoOffset` is the active font's own real height if the name
//      string is non-empty (confirmed directly against the real
//      Gamebuino.cpp source - see gameInvaders.c's own header comment for
//      the fullest writeup of this formula already done in this project).
//      Upstream's own name string is `" "` (one space) - non-empty by
//      length, so the offset applies: with font5x7 active (set in setup()
//      just before this call, height 7+1=8), the logo lands at exactly
//      `(0, 20)` - and the logo is 64x28, so 20+28=48 lands flush with the
//      real screen's own bottom edge, a good sanity check that the formula
//      was applied correctly. The space character itself is invisible, so
//      it isn't drawn; a "PRESS A" hint (this project's own established
//      stand-in for the real blinking-A-icon prompt real titleScreen()
//      draws, see gameSimonbuino.c/gameFlappyBirdo.c) fills the resulting
//      gap above the logo instead.
//   2. `gb.menu(menu, 4)` (Survival/Status/Controls/Change Game) -> a
//      custom SMASH_STATE_MENU list, modeled directly on gameCrazyCar.c's
//      own difficulty-menu precedent for this exact situation (up/down to
//      move a ">" cursor, A to confirm, B to cancel back to the title -
//      matching upstream's own `case -1: gb.titleScreen(...)`).
//      "Change Game" (upstream: `gb.changeGame()`, a real-hardware
//      "switch to a different game on the SD card" OS feature) has no
//      equivalent in this single-cartridge menu model - this cartridge's
//      actual equivalent gesture is the real Start button, handled
//      globally by portVircon32.c outside any individual game's own code
//      - so selecting it here just returns to the title screen, the
//      closest available outcome rather than a dead, unresponsive button.
//
// `maps()` (the map-picker: LEFT/RIGHT with `gb.buttons.repeat(..,15)` to
// cycle Lonely/Ridge/Tower/Hill, A to confirm) is a real, already-
// non-blocking-shaped upstream loop (its own `while(gb.update())`) and
// ported nearly verbatim as SMASH_STATE_MAPSELECT. `play()` (the main
// blocking gameplay loop, gated by its own `alive`/`pause` flags) became
// SMASH_STATE_PLAY, with those two flags preserved as-is rather than split
// into further states, since upstream itself already treats them as
// sub-modes of one screen, not separate blocking calls.
//
// `gb.buttons.repeat(BTN_x, N)` calls port directly as `gbRepeat(BTN_x, N)`
// - this shim's `gbRepeat()` now matches real `Buttons::repeat()` exactly
// (period<=1 fires every held frame, period>1 fires once then every period
// frames), so every one of this game's own repeat() calls (movement at
// period 2, jump/pause at period 20, run-modifier at period 1, map-cycling
// at period 15) was carried over unchanged.
//
// `gb.collideBitmapBitmap()` (real pixel-perfect bitmap collision) ported
// as this shim's own real `gbCollideBitmapBitmap()` throughout - every
// real upstream collision check in this game (player/meteor/arrow vs.
// platform/platform2, and the 4 hazards vs. the player) uses it, matching
// upstream's own exact call shape one-for-one.
//
// A REAL BUG, FOUND AND FIXED: an earlier pass through this file used
// `gbCollideRectRect()` instead (this shim had no `gbCollideBitmapBitmap()`
// primitive yet at the time this game was first ported - it was promoted
// to the shared shim only once `gameDescent.c`'s own port needed it later
// in the same batch, and this file was never revisited afterward). That
// substitution was reasoned to be exact for the platform/platform2 sprites
// specifically (both are genuinely solid-filled bitmaps, every real byte
// 0xFF, so a bounding-box test against either one alone really is
// pixel-exact) - but that reasoning never checked the PLAYER's own
// bitmap (`smashPlayerBitmap`), which has real transparent pixels of its
// own, including a fully empty bottom row (every column's real byte has
// its bit 7 clear). A rect-rect test still treats the player as a solid
// 8x8 block regardless, so the instant a jump moved the player up by its
// own real 1px impulse, the coarser rect test still reported "still
// touching the platform" (the two bounding boxes still technically
// overlapped by a few pixels) even though the real, pixel-perfect test
// upstream actually uses would not have - the player's own real empty
// bottom row means no actual "on" pixel from the player ever touches the
// platform's own real top row at that offset. The immediate re-collision
// snapped the player straight back to standing (`smashPlayerY` reset,
// `smashPlayerGrav = 0`) within the very same frame, before the jump
// could ever become visible - a complete, permanent inability to jump at
// all, confirmed directly via Puppeteer (held Button A continuously for
// 80+ frames, well past the real `gbRepeat(BTN_A,20)` threshold multiple
// times over, with the player never leaving the ground). Fixed by
// restoring the real `gbCollideBitmapBitmap()` calls project-wide in this
// file, matching upstream exactly - re-verified via Puppeteer afterward
// that a single A-press now visibly lifts the player off the platform.
//
// SEVERAL REAL, VERIFIED UPSTREAM BUGS - all preserved deliberately,
// per this project's own "preserve real upstream behavior by default"
// norm, since none of them are catastrophic and every one was traced
// through by hand rather than guessed at:
//
//   1. **Ball/arrow horizontal speed is not what the source says it is.**
//      `arrowx`/`ballx`/`bally`/`ballyv` are all declared plain `int` (not
//      `float`) upstream, yet stepped by float literals (`arrowx = arrowx
//      + 1.5;`, `ballx = ballx - 1.5;`) - every such assignment truncates
//      toward zero on write-back to the `int`. Traced by hand: adding 1.5
//      to an integer and truncating always yields `+1` (e.g. 3+1.5=4.5 ->
//      4), but *subtracting* 1.5 and truncating always yields `-2` (e.g.
//      3-1.5=1.5 -> 1, a drop of 2) - a real, asymmetric consequence of
//      `int` truncation rounding toward zero either way. So `arrowx`
//      (always `+1.5`) actually advances at a real 1px/frame (not the
//      intended 1.5), while `ballx` moving left (`way==0`, `-1.5`) actually
//      advances at a real 2px/frame - twice its own rightward counterpart.
//      Reproduced here with explicit `(int)(...)` casts on every such
//      line, both to guarantee this dialect truncates the same way
//      standard C does and to make the real, intentional-looking-but-buggy
//      truncation visible rather than accidental-looking.
//   2. **The ball's vertical speed is similarly not 1.5.** `int ballyv =
//      -1.5;` truncates to `-1` at first assignment, and every later
//      `ballyv = 1.5;`/`ballyv = -1.5;` (on hitting the top/bottom of its
//      own bounce range) truncates to plain `+1`/`-1` too - so `ballyv` is
//      really always exactly Β±1, never Β±1.5, and (unlike point 1 above)
//      this one isn't even asymmetric, since `bally = bally + ballyv` is a
//      plain int+int add with no further truncation surprise.
//   3. **The ball never actually moves right, ever, for the game's entire
//      real life.** `way = random(0,1);` - and real Arduino `random(min,
//      max)` has an EXCLUSIVE upper bound, so `random(0,1)` can only ever
//      return `0`, never `1` - a well-known real Arduino gotcha, not a
//      typo. Ported faithfully as `arand(1)` (this shim's own established
//      `min + arand(max-min)` mapping, `arand(1)` always returning 0 for
//      the exact same reason). The practical effect: every time the ball
//      wraps offscreen, `way` is deterministically reset to 0, so `ballx`
//      is always reset to 82 (moving left) - the entire `way==1`
//      (`ballx = 1`, moving right) branch is real, permanently dead code,
//      on real hardware as much as here.
//   4. **The Black Hole disaster is real but under-weighted.** `disaster =
//      random(1,12);` - again an exclusive upper bound, so `disaster`'s
//      real range is `[1,11]`, not `[1,12]`. Meteor/Arrow/Ball each own a
//      3-value window (1-3/4-6/7-9), but Black Hole's own checked window
//      (`>=10 && <=12`) can only ever actually be hit by 10 or 11 - a real
//      2-in-11 chance versus everyone else's 3-in-11. Ported as `1 +
//      arand(11)`, which reproduces this exact imbalance automatically
//      (no extra code needed - `arand()`'s own exclusive upper bound
//      matches Arduino's `random()` for free here).
//   5. **The Ridge map's "Arrow Collision" block tests the METEOR's
//      position against 2 of its 4 platforms, not the arrow's.** Read
//      directly off upstream: `(collideBitmapBitmap(arrowx,arrowy,arrow,
//      0,28,platform2)) || (...,60,28,platform2) || (collideBitmapBitmap(
//      meteorx,meteory,meteor,18,44,platform2)) || (...meteorx,meteory,
//      meteor,42,44,platform2))` - the last two conditions plainly use
//      `meteorx`/`meteory`/`meteor`, not the arrow's own variables/sprite,
//      inside a block whose own comment and reset action
//      (`arrowx=0;arrowy=random(...)`) are both about the arrow. A real
//      copy-paste artifact: on the Ridge map, the arrow only genuinely
//      resets on touching the two TOP platforms, but *also* resets
//      whenever the METEOR (regardless of the arrow's own real position)
//      happens to touch either of the two BOTTOM platforms. Copied
//      verbatim, variable mix-up and all.
//   6. **The Tower map's player-landing check has a fifth, bogus branch**:
//      `else if(collideBitmapBitmap(playerx,playery,player,0,0,platform)
//      == true){ playergrav = 1; }` - no platform is ever actually drawn
//      at `(0,0)` on this map (the real drawn set is `(0,44,platform)`,
//      `(30,28,platform2)`, `(30,16,platform2)`, `(18,0,platform2)`,
//      `(42,0,platform2)`). Since `platform` is 88px wide (the *whole*
//      screen width) and 4px tall, this phantom check's own real bounding
//      box spans the full width of row y=0-3 - so whenever the player's
//      own box reaches that height (jumping near the very top of the
//      screen), this branch fires anywhere across the full width, setting
//      `playergrav = 1` (a small downward nudge) instead of falling into
//      the normal `else` branch's `playergrav = playergrav + 1` gravity
//      accumulation. The real, if surely unintended, effect: an invisible
//      full-width "soft ceiling" gently nudges the player back down near
//      the top of this one map, rather than a real climbable platform
//      being there. Copied verbatim (same coordinates, same bitmap).
//   7. **The Tower map's meteor-vs-platform collision only checks 3 of its
//      5 drawn platforms** (`(18,0,platform2)`, `(42,0,platform2)`,
//      `(0,44,platform)` - both `(30,28,platform2)` and `(30,16,
//      platform2)` are never tested), so a falling meteor on this map can
//      visibly clip straight through either of those two middle platforms
//      instead of exploding on contact. Copied verbatim (same 3 checks,
//      no 4th/5th added).
//   8. **`arrowy`'s own reset range is inconsistent between call sites**:
//      most resets use `random(0,34)`, but the in-play wraparound reset
//      (`if(arrowx >= 80){ ...; arrowy = random(6,34); }`) and the Tower
//      map's own Arrow Collision reset both use `random(6,34)` instead -
//      copied verbatim at each call site (`arand(34)` vs `6 + arand(28)`)
//      rather than normalized to one range.
//
// Sound: `gb.sound.playNote(pitch,dur,channel)`/`gb.sound.command(...)`
// ported via this shim's real `gbPlayNoteChannel()`/`gbSoundCommand()`
// tracker/pattern primitives, restoring every real per-note effect
// (waveform/pitch-slide) at its own real channel (0 for the jump tone,
// 1 for both the running-boost tone and the death tone - matching
// upstream's own literal channel arguments exactly). The 5 real upstream
// call sites that play an identical "player died"
// `playNote(1,28,1)`+`command(1,1,0,1)`+`command(2,7,-2,1)` sequence
// (falling off the bottom, and each of the 4 hazard types) were
// consolidated into one local `smashKillPlayer()` helper - a plain
// de-duplication of literally identical code, not a behavior change.
//
// `gb.getCpuLoad()`/`gb.getFreeRam()` (the Status menu screen) and
// `gb.battery.show` are real hardware-introspection features with no
// meaning on a virtual console - matching this project's own established
// "drop `battery.show`, it's cosmetic" precedent, the Status screen itself
// is kept (so the real menu still has 4 working entries) but shows literal
// "N/A" placeholders instead of inventing fake numbers. This is a
// deliberate simplification of a real-hardware-only concept, not a shim
// gap that needs fixing.
//
// The real upstream `"    Loading...."` message (printed, then
// immediately overwritten the same tick by `maps()`'s own first
// `gb.update()` cycle, with no delay in between) was dropped outright - on
// real hardware whether this is ever actually visible for even one frame
// depends on exact SPI/display-flip timing this project has no way to
// reproduce faithfully, and either way it's purely cosmetic with zero
// gameplay effect.
//
// Real icon glyphs `\25`/`\26`/`\27` (octal - ASCII 21/22/23, real
// Gamebuino low-range button-icon glyphs, confirmed already covered by
// this shim's font tables) can't be embedded in a plain quoted string
// literal, so each line using one was built as an explicit `int[]` array
// instead (see gameTaquin.c's own `taqRestartText` for the established
// precedent this follows exactly).
//
// Bitmap fill/mask check (per this project's own established "look for a
// GRAY mask/fill pass drawn before the real outline bitmap" bug class -
// see gameFlappyBirdo.c's own header comment for that bug's full history):
// checked directly against both real source files (SmashandCrash.ino,
// Maps.ino) - every single `gb.display.drawBitmap(...)` call in this game
// stands alone, with no `setColor(GRAY)` or plain fill drawn underneath it
// first anywhere in the real source. That bug class does not apply here.
//
// All 9 real PROGMEM bitmaps (player, platform, platform2, meteor, arrow,
// point, Title, blow, ball, bhole) are restored verbatim below, with every
// real `B00000000`-style Arduino binary literal mechanically converted to
// `0x`-prefixed hex (byte-for-byte, computed directly from the real source
// rather than hand-transcribed, to rule out transcription error).
