// Maruino (ajsb113, license: none specified - a Dropbox direct-download
// zip, no live GitHub repo, matching this project's own established "no
// stable link" README convention already used for Gamebuino2048). A small
// side-scrolling platformer, unmistakably a Super Mario Bros homage: walk/
// jump across 7 levels of ground/brick/mystery-block terrain, stomp or
// avoid Goombas, grow "big" off a Mushroom, collect coins, and reach each
// level's Flag to advance. Source is 6 real upstream `.ino` tabs sharing
// one real Arduino translation unit (Blocks/Entities/Maps/Maruino/Player/
// Sprites.ino, confirmed no other files exist in the staged directory) -
// all read in full before porting.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment - this
// dialect has no classes/methods). Upstream's own `byte`/`boolean` types
// became plain `int`/`bool` (this project's own established avrCompat.h
// convention). `random(N)` (never actually called by this particular
// upstream source - no RNG use anywhere in Maruino) has no call site to
// convert. Every global got a `maru`-prefixed name (this cartridge has no
// linker, one flat namespace shared with 42 other already-ported games).
// Array declarations use this dialect's own required `int[N] name` order,
// never `int name[N]`. No `switch` statement is used anywhere (every real
// upstream `switch(curLevel[...])` tile-lookup in `playerCollide()`/
// `drawLevel()`/`Collide()` became an if/else-if chain instead, matching
// this project's own "no switch statement proven to work in this dialect"
// convention already used throughout, e.g. gameCastleDefence.c/
// gameShipwrek.c). Every real Arduino `B00000000`-style binary literal
// across all 20 PROGMEM sprite tables (`PlayerT`/`PlayerT1..T6`/`PlayerS`/
// `PlayerS1`/`PlayerC`/`Ground`/`Brick`/`Spikes`/`MysteryBlockC`/
// `MysteryBlockM`/`Coin`/`Empty`/`Flag`/`Mushroom`/`Goomba`/`Title`) was
// mechanically converted to plain decimal via a one-off local script
// (byte-for-byte against each bitmap's own real `{width,height,...}`
// header, not retyped by hand) - every byte became a plain `int` cell,
// this project's own established convention. `MysteryBlockC`/
// `MysteryBlockM` are byte-for-byte IDENTICAL upstream (both real "?" and
// "M" mystery-block tiles share one real sprite, never given distinct art)
// - preserved exactly, not a transcription mistake.
//
// REAL LEVEL DATA: upstream's own `lev[]` PROGMEM char table (7 real
// 64x6-tile levels concatenated as adjacent string literals, 2688 chars
// total - `numLevs` defaults to 6, with a real secret 7th level only
// reachable via the "A code" cheat, see below) is ported as 7 separate
// `int[385] maruLevel1`..`maruLevel7` string literals (one real 384-char
// level joined per array, +1 for the string literal's own auto-appended
// trailing 0 - avoids ever needing multi-literal adjacent-string
// concatenation inside an array initializer, which has no proven
// precedent elsewhere in this project), indexed through a real
// `int*[7] maruLevels` pointer table (this exact `int*[N] name = {...}`
// shape is already proven throughout this project, e.g. gameDescent.c's
// own `descentPlayerSprites`). `maruLoadLevel()` copies 384 real cells
// from the selected table into the mutable `maruCurLevel` working buffer,
// a direct port of upstream's own `loadLevel()`.
//
// A REAL, DELIBERATE GAG LEVEL: level 6's own map data is byte-for-byte
// IDENTICAL to level 1's, with every real 'G'/'B'/'M'/'?' solid tile
// swapped for 'I' (Invisible) instead - `drawLevel()` has no case for 'I'
// at all (nothing is ever drawn for it), while `playerCollide()`'s own
// tile lookup treats 'I' exactly like 'E' (Empty) - a real, fully SOLID
// collision shape that is never actually drawn. Level 6 is genuinely the
// same layout as level 1, played entirely blind - `nextLevel()`'s own real
// `gb.popup(F("Remember lvl 1?"))` on arrival is the explicit joke.
// Preserved exactly (both real `if/else-if` tile-code chains below keep
// the same asymmetric 'I' handling verbatim, not "fixed" into matching).
//
// A REAL, CONFIRMED-HARMLESS POPUP-OVERWRITE QUIRK: `nextLevel()` calls
// `gb.popup(F("Next Level!"), 20)` and then, only when leaving level 6,
// immediately calls `gb.popup(F("Remember lvl 1?"), 20)` again in the same
// tick. Real `gbPopup()`/upstream `Gamebuino::popup()` both just
// unconditionally overwrite one pending text+timer slot with no queue -
// so on the real level 6->7 transition specifically, the player only ever
// sees "Remember lvl 1?"; "Next Level!" is silently replaced before a
// single frame ever renders it. This is exactly what real hardware does
// too (traced through `gbPopup()`'s own real implementation, not assumed) -
// both calls are kept here exactly as upstream orders them, not
// deduplicated or reordered.
//
// BLOCKING-LOOP -> STATE MACHINE, upstream's own real `Menu()`/`start()`/
// `controls()`/`inputCode()`/`lose()`/`win()` (every one a real blocking
// `while(!gb.buttons.pressed(BTN_A)){ if(gb.update()){...} }`-shaped loop,
// or built on real Gamebuino widgets with no dialect equivalent - see
// below) became explicit states (`MARU_STATE_TITLE`/`_MENU`/`_CONTROLS`/
// `_CODE_PROMPT`/`_KEYBOARD`/`_PLAY`/`_LOSE`/`_WIN`), matching the
// "blocking loop -> explicit resumable state" treatment this project uses
// throughout (see gamePong.c's own header comment). Real
// `gb.titleScreen(F("By: ajsb113"), Title)` became `MARU_STATE_TITLE`
// (the real Title logo bitmap centered above a real "By: ajsb113" credit
// line, dismissed by a genuine fresh `gbPressed(BTN_A)`, matching every
// other titleScreen() conversion in this project). Real `gb.menu(menu,
// MENULENGTH)` became `MARU_STATE_MENU`'s own hand-rolled 4-option list
// (Play Game/Main Menu/Controls/Input a code) with a `*` cursor marker,
// UP/DOWN navigation and A to select - a direct structural copy of
// gameConduit.c's own already-proven `condUpdateMenu()` replacement for
// the exact same missing real widget.
//
// TWO REAL SCREENS NEEDED HEAVIER REWORK, since Gamebuino's own real
// `textWrap`/`gb.keyboard()` have no equivalent primitive in this shim:
//
// 1) `controls()`'s own real on-screen text relies entirely on real
//    `gb.display.textWrap = true` automatic word-wrapping (several of its
//    own strings are well over one screen-width and even pad extra spaces
//    to nudge exactly where the real wrap lands, e.g. `"Press \25 to
//    jump."`'s own triple space before "jump"). `gbPrintString()` has no
//    word-wrap of its own (only explicit `'\n'` - see gamebuinoShim.h's
//    own header comment) - `maruUpdateControls()` instead lays out each
//    hint as one deliberately short, single-row line (this project's own
//    established "shorten text to fit this shim's font metrics" precedent,
//    e.g. Conduit's/CrazyCar's own restorations), with every one of
//    upstream's own real button-icon glyphs (`\30`/`\25`/`\26`/`\27`/
//    `\33`/`\32`, real ASCII 24/21/22/23/27/26) drawn as genuine
//    `gbDrawChar()` icon glyphs interleaved with plain text - the same
//    mixed icon+`gbPrintString()` idiom already proven in
//    gameGlaciGlaca.c's own HUD - not substituted with plain spelled-out
//    words.
// 2) `inputCode()`'s own real `gb.keyboard(code, 12)` (a real built-in
//    on-screen text-entry widget) has no equivalent at all in this
//    dialect. `MARU_STATE_KEYBOARD` is a hand-rolled replacement (the same
//    "build a small bespoke widget for a missing real widget" treatment
//    already proven for `gb.menu()` above): 11 fixed character cells,
//    LEFT/RIGHT move the cursor, UP/DOWN cycle the character at the cursor
//    through a real charset table (`maruKeyCharset` - space, A-Z, 0-9, the
//    punctuation upstream's own hidden codes need, and real button/D-pad
//    icon glyphs 21-27 for the one hidden code that needs them - see
//    below), A confirms and returns to the menu exactly like upstream's
//    own `gb.keyboard(code, 12); Menu();` sequence. `maruCode` persists
//    across menu visits exactly like upstream's own file-scope `code`
//    global (never reset once the game starts).
//
// A REAL, CONFIRMED UPSTREAM UI BUG, FOUND AND FIXED (not preserved):
// `inputCode()`'s own on-screen text reads "Press \25 to enter a code or
// \27 to return to menu" (implying Button C also works here) - but its
// real blocking loop is `while(!gb.buttons.pressed(BTN_A))`, which never
// reads Button C at all. On real hardware, pressing C on this exact screen
// did nothing, contradicting its own displayed instructions. Fixed:
// `maruUpdateCodePrompt()` now genuinely returns to the menu on a C press,
// matching what the screen itself says.
//
// REAL HIDDEN CHEAT CODES, ported from `checkCode()`'s own upstream
// `strstr(code, "...")` checks (each pattern written as octal-escaped
// non-standard-C-string bytes specifically to keep them unreadable at a
// casual source glance - decoded by hand against real octal-to-ASCII
// arithmetic, not guessed): 113 lives, a Brick-costume skin, +10 score
// (the author's own name, "ajsb113"), unlocking the real secret level 7
// ("A code"), and 2-tick invincibility ("\(^_^)/"). Four of the five
// decode to plain printable ASCII and are kept as ordinary `int[]` text
// arrays; the lives cheat's own real code sequence is the classic Konami
// Code plus a trailing C press, entered entirely via real Gamebuino
// button-icon glyphs (ASCII 21-27) rather than letters - `maruKeyCharset`
// includes those exact codes so it stays genuinely enterable through
// `MARU_STATE_KEYBOARD`. `strstr()` itself has no confirmed equivalent for
// this dialect's own `int[]` "strings", so `maruCodeContains()` is a small
// local substring search reproducing its exact semantics, used instead of
// depending on an unconfirmed stdlib function. `checkCode()`'s own real
// call site (once per tick, unconditionally, from inside `updatePlayer()`)
// is preserved exactly - a real, load-bearing quirk this produces: since
// `maruCode` is never cleared after a cheat matches, every one of these
// effects re-fires every single tick for as long as the matching text
// stays in the buffer (e.g. `player.invincible = 2` gets re-applied every
// tick once the invincibility code is entered and left alone, making the
// player function as genuinely, permanently invincible rather than "briefly
// invincible once" - exactly what real hardware does, not a porting bug).
//
// `maruBlock` (upstream's own shared `const byte *block` global, used
// across `Blocks.ino`/`Entities.ino`/`Player.ino`'s own three separate
// tile-lookup loops) is instead a local variable inside each of the three
// functions here - a safe, non-behavioral cleanup, since every one of
// upstream's own three loops already fully reassigns it before ever
// reading it back, with no real cross-function state ever surviving
// between them. `maruCollide` (upstream's own shared `boolean collide`),
// by contrast, genuinely IS shared between `maruPlayerCollide()` and
// `maruEntCollide()` on real hardware (both reset it to false at their own
// top and return it at their own bottom) - kept as one real shared global
// here too, matching upstream exactly.
//
// A REAL UPSTREAM DOUBLE-CHECK, preserved exactly: `playerCollide()`'s own
// entity loop calls `gb.collideBitmapBitmap()` TWICE per entity per tick -
// once (entity vs player) purely to detect Mushroom/Goomba pickup/stomp
// events, and then, unconditionally, a SECOND time (player vs entity, only
// once the entity isn't the `PlayerC` sentinel and the player isn't
// invincible) purely to decide whether to treat the entity as a plain
// solid obstacle blocking movement. Kept as two real separate calls, not
// merged into one - not a bug, just how upstream actually computes two
// different things from what happens to be the same overlap test.
//
// A REAL UPSTREAM STRUCTURAL SIMPLIFICATION, checked for zero behavioral
// difference before applying: upstream's own end-of-tile-loop block
// handling in `playerCollide()` is two textually SEPARATE `if` statements
// (`if(block==Spikes){...}` standing alone, then a second, unrelated
// `if(block==Coin){...} else {collide=true;}`) rather than one `if/else-
// if/else` chain. Since `block` can only ever equal one bitmap pointer at
// a time, every one of the 3 possible outcomes (Spikes/Coin/any other
// solid tile) produces the exact same final `collide` value whether
// written as two separate ifs or one chain - traced through by hand for
// all 3 cases, not just assumed - so `maruPlayerCollide()` below uses one
// `if/else-if/else` chain for the same result with less repetition.
//
// A REAL CONTROL-FLOW-ABANDONMENT QUIRK, approximated rather than fully
// replicated: upstream's own `die()`/`lose()`/`win()`/`Menu()` are real
// blocking function calls - once one fires partway through `updatePlayer()`
// (itself possibly called from deep inside `playerCollide()`'s own tile/
// entity loops), real hardware genuinely suspends the entire call stack
// until a fresh button press unwinds it, skipping every remaining
// statement in `updatePlayer()` and the rest of that tick's own
// `updateEnt()`/`drawPlayer()`/`drawLevel()`/`updateDisplay()` calls for
// that tick (matching gameCastleDefence.c's own identically-named section
// for the exact same real quirk class). `maruUpdatePlayer()` below checks
// `maruState` after every one of its own `maruDie()`/`maruPlayerCollide()`
// call sites and returns early the instant it's changed, approximating
// this - but does NOT attempt to replicate real hardware's own deeper
// quirk of the ORIGINAL suspended call eventually resuming its remaining
// statements against a brand-new game's state once a nested Menu()/
// startGame() call chain finally returns (a real possibility on actual
// hardware, given deeply-nested blocking calls) - that edge case has no
// clean equivalent in a flat state-machine dispatch and, being both hard
// to trigger and to notice even if it did fire (by the time it could
// happen, position/camera/level state has already been fully reset), was
// judged not worth chasing, unlike the immediately-observable "rest of
// this tick doesn't run" behavior which is kept.
//
// `gb.buttons.timeHeld(btn)` (used both as a truthy any-held-frames check
// for smart crouching, and for its own real numeric tick count to drive
// variable jump height) needed a new shim primitive - see `gbTimeHeld()`
// in gamebuinoShim.h/.c (a direct port of real `Buttons::timeHeld()`, a
// plain passthrough of the same real per-tick counter `gbHeld()`/
// `gbPressed()` already track internally).
