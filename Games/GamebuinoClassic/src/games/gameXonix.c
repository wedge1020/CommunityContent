// Xonix (Tnxec2 / Nikolas Maletschkin, license: None specified - confirmed
// directly against the real repo, github.com/Tnxec2/xonix-gamebuino: there
// is no LICENSE/COPYING file anywhere in it and neither `XONIX.ino` nor
// `PrintUtils.ino` carries a license header of its own; the author name
// comes from the repo's own real commit authorship). A real Xonix clone for
// Gamebuino Classic - steer a cursor out of the already-claimed border into
// the open field, drawing a trail behind it, and get back to claimed
// territory to enclose (and claim) everything the trail cut off. Claim 75%
// of the board to advance a level; touching your own trail, or letting a
// roaming enemy touch either you or your trail, costs one of three lives.
// Each level adds one more enemy (and refunds one life, up to 3); clearing
// the level that already has all 10 enemies wins the game outright.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site is mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment for why -
// this dialect has no classes/methods). Every global got an `xnx`-prefixed
// name, since this cartridge has no linker and every ported game shares one
// flat global namespace. Upstream's own `coords` struct (a plain x/y int
// pair, used for the player, the player's velocity, and both enemy arrays)
// is flattened into separate scalar/array globals - the same "flatten a
// small aggregate into plain named globals/parallel arrays" treatment used
// throughout this project (see gamePunkt.c/gameSnake5110.c) - which also
// sidesteps upstream's own `enemys[i] = {-1, -1}` brace-initializer
// assignments, a form this dialect has no equivalent for. Upstream's own
// `B00000000`-style Arduino binary bitmap literals (the 64x30 title logo,
// the 5x4 heart, the 2x2 trail dot) were converted to hex byte-for-byte by
// script, no bit reshuffling needed - this shim's own gbDrawBitmap() reads
// the exact same row-major/MSB-first layout real Display::drawBitmap() does.
// `random(a, b)` became `a + arand(b - a)` and `random(n)` became `arand(n)`
// (this project's own established ranged-random rewrite). The two `? :`
// ternaries upstream uses (the enemy's random initial velocity signs, and
// the player cell's own draw color) became explicit if/else - this dialect
// has no ternary operator at all.
//
// `PrintUtils.ino` IS this author's own reusable helper file, shared
// verbatim with his other Gamebuino titles - confirmed by direct comparison
// against `snake-gamebuino-classic`, already shipped in this cartridge as
// `gameSnakeClassic.c`, whose own header comment describes the identical
// `popup()`/`updatePopup()`/`printCentered()` trio. Xonix uses exactly one
// piece of it for real: the `printCentered(const __FlashStringHelper*)`
// overload, ported here as `xnxPrintCentered()` (with a local
// `xnxStrLen()` standing in for `strlen_PF()`, which only exists on AVR to
// reach flash). The rest is dead code and is dropped: the `char*`
// `printCentered()` overload is never called at all, and while
// `updatePopup()` IS called once per tick, `popup()` never is anywhere in
// the game, so `popupTimeLeft` is permanently 0 and the popup box can never
// appear on real hardware either. (This shim does have a real `gbPopup()`
// primitive, but wiring it in here would invent a UI element the real game
// never shows.)
//
// TIMING: upstream throttles player/enemy movement on raw Arduino
// `millis()` (`currentTime - prevTime >= delayTime`, delayTime 200ms) on top
// of `gb.update()`'s own frame throttle. Vircon32 has no wall-clock
// primitive, so `xnxMillis()` derives a millisecond clock from
// `gbFrameCount * 50` (the real 20fps default tick period - see
// gamebuinoShim.h's own gbBegin() comment), matching gameCruiser.c's own
// already-established `cruiMillis()` precedent. The comparison itself is
// left in upstream's exact original shape rather than rewritten into a tick
// count, so the real 200ms threshold stays visible at the call site: with
// the real 20fps default upstream itself never overrides (it never calls
// `gb.setFrameRate()`), this works out to one move every 4 ticks, exactly
// like real hardware. `xnxPrevTime` is deliberately NOT reset by
// `xnxInitGame()` - upstream's own `prevTime` is a plain global its
// `initGame()` never touches either.
//
// BLOCKING TITLE SCREEN -> EXPLICIT STATE: upstream's own real
// `gb.titleScreen(F("Xonix by TnxEc2"), logo)` (shown once from `setup()`,
// and re-entered whenever Button C is pressed mid-game) is a blocking call,
// converted here into an explicit XNX_STATE_TITLE state, matching the
// treatment used throughout this project (see gamePong.c/gameLightsOutAD.c).
// The real 64x30 logo bitmap is drawn via gbDrawBitmap(), centered
// horizontally (real hardware's own fixed x=0 placement only makes sense
// alongside its own boot-logo furniture, which this shim has no equivalent
// for), with upstream's own real title string and a "PRESS A" prompt under
// it. Upstream continues straight into the same tick's drawing after
// `titleScreen()` returns (its `initGame()` call happens inline, then
// execution falls through to `drawField()`), and both directions of the
// state switch here preserve that "no dropped frame" shape exactly: the A
// press that leaves the title screen draws the fresh board in the very same
// tick, and the C press that returns to it draws the title screen in the
// very same tick.
//
// No EEPROM/highscore exists upstream at all (confirmed by grep across both
// real source files - there is no score concept in this game beyond the
// live enemy count and the claimed-area percentage, neither of which is
// persisted), so none was invented here, per this project's own "don't
// invent a highscore concept real upstream never had" precedent. Upstream
// never calls `setFont()` either, so this port inherits this shim's own real
// `gbFont3x5` default exactly like upstream inherits real hardware's -
// which matters, since both `drawScore()`'s own score position and the
// status banner's own height are computed from the live `fontHeight`.
// `Serial.begin(9600)` (never written to afterwards) and
// `gb.battery.show = false` (a real-hardware-only cosmetic indicator) are
// both dropped outright, matching every other port's own treatment.
//
// REAL UPSTREAM QUIRKS PRESERVED DELIBERATELY (none of these is a porting
// mistake - each is exactly how the real game behaves on real hardware):
//
// - **The bucket-fill's own off-by-one neighbour guards.** `claimBoard()`'s
//   flood fill tests `row > 1`/`col > 1` before looking at the cell above/
//   left, where `row > 0`/`col > 0` is what the symmetric `row <
//   BOARDHEIGHT - 1`/`col < BOARDWIDTH - 1` guards on the other two sides
//   imply. Harmless in practice, and provably so rather than just
//   apparently: row 0 and column 0 are set CELL_CLAIMED by `clearBoard()`
//   and nothing ever unsets them, so the skipped reads could never have
//   found the CELL_EMPTY the test is looking for anyway. Reproduced
//   verbatim rather than "corrected".
//
// - **The duplicated claim condition in `move()`.** The identical
//   `oldPlayerStat != CELL_CLAIMED && board[player] == CELL_CLAIMED` test is
//   written out twice in a row, once to call `claimBoard()` and once to zero
//   the player's velocity. `claimBoard()` never changes the player's own
//   cell away from CELL_CLAIMED, so the second test always agrees with the
//   first - kept as two separate statements exactly as upstream wrote them.
//
// - **`oldPlayerStat` is sampled before the trail is marked.** `move()`
//   reads the player's current cell into `oldPlayerStat` first, and only
//   then overwrites a CELL_EMPTY cell with CELL_LINE - so a player standing
//   on open field records EMPTY, not LINE. This is load-bearing (it is what
//   makes "was outside, now inside" detect a completed loop), not an
//   ordering accident, and is preserved exactly.
//
// - **Enemies can slip diagonally into claimed territory.** An enemy bounces
//   by testing only its two orthogonal neighbours, then moves on both axes
//   at once - so when both orthogonal cells are open but the diagonal one is
//   claimed, it steps right onto the claimed cell. It bounces straight back
//   out the following tick (from inside solid claimed ground both tests fire
//   and both velocities flip), so this shows up as an enemy briefly clipping
//   the corner of a claimed region. Left exactly as upstream has it.
//
// NO OUT-OF-BOUNDS RISK FROM THE ENEMY BOUNCE READS, checked rather than
// assumed: `board[enemys[i].x + enemys_velocity[i].x][enemys[i].y]` looks
// like a classic unguarded neighbour read (this platform would hand back an
// arbitrary adjacent global rather than real AVR's harmless flash garbage,
// and `claimBoard()`'s own `board[enemy] = CELL_EMPTY` is a genuine WRITE),
// but the board's outermost ring is CELL_CLAIMED from `clearBoard()` onward
// and is never unclaimed by anything, which pins every enemy inside
// [1, BOARDWIDTH-2] x [1, BOARDHEIGHT-2] permanently: reaching column 0
// would require passing the bounce test against column 0 itself, which is
// always claimed, and the diagonal-entry case above lands on a cell whose
// own orthogonal test already proved it is not on the ring. Enemies also
// start well inside (`random(10, BOARDWIDTH - 10)`) and never take a zero
// velocity. So every index stays in range by construction and no defensive
// clamp was added - the neighbour reads are ported literally.

// Upstream's own real constants. BOARDWIDTH/BOARDHEIGHT/LEVELCLEARRATE are
// reproduced with upstream's own exact parenthesization (see this project's
// own real Skibuino macro bug for why that is checked rather than tidied):
// 84 - 7 leaves a 7px-wide status strip on the right, /2 gives a 38x24 cell
// board, and 38 * 24 / 100 * 75 is 675 claimed cells to clear a level (the
// integer division truncating first, upstream's own real behaviour).
