// Shipwrek (yawn-g, license: none specified upstream - github.com/yawn-g/
// shipwrek). A two-player, single-cartridge Battleship: each player places
// 5 boats (Cruiser..Carrier) on their own hidden 9x9 grid, then players
// alternate turns firing at the other's grid until every one of an
// opponent's boats is sunk. Picked from `more games/` per this project's
// own DISCOVERED_GAMES.md porting-priority audit, specifically as a real,
// expected EEPROM consumer (see the EEPROM section below for why that
// expectation did NOT pan out once the real source was read).
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (see gamePong.c's own header comment - this
// dialect has no classes/methods). Every global got a `ship`-prefixed name
// (this cartridge has no linker). Upstream's own `switch(b){case 4: ...}`
// bitmap/text dispatches (draw_boat(), sunk_popup()) became if/else-if
// chains (no switch statement proven to work in this dialect - see this
// project's own CLAUDE.md). Every real `B00000000`-style Arduino binary
// literal across all 13 PROGMEM bitmap tables (carrier/submarine/cruiser/
// battle_ship/destroyer/logo/clouds/cloudsW/clouds2/game_text/
// game_outline/over_text/over_outline) was mechanically converted to `0x`
// hex via a one-off script (byte-for-byte, verified against the source -
// not retyped by hand) - every byte became a plain `int` cell, matching
// this project's own established convention. `random(15,70)` (Arduino's
// ranged random, exclusive upper bound) became `arand(55) + 15`.
// `gb.pickRandomSeed()` -> `gbPickRandomSeed()` (documented no-op).
// `Serial.begin(9600)` and `gb.battery.show = false` were both dropped
// outright (real-hardware-only debug/cosmetic concerns with no equivalent
// here - same treatment gamePong.c already gave `gb.battery.show`).
// Upstream's own `char`/`byte` arrays all became plain `int` (this dialect
// has no byte-width types - see this project's own CLAUDE.md dialect
// rules); array declarations use this dialect's own `int[N] name` order
// throughout, never `int name[N]`.
//
// Upstream's own boolean-flip idiom for a 0/1 value x (`-x + 1`, used for
// `boat_rot = -boat_rot + 1;`, `shots[-p+1]`, `-p+1`, `sunk(-p+1, ...)`,
// `p_name[-p+1]` etc, all over the source) is rewritten everywhere here as
// the equivalent `1 - x` - purely a readability substitution, not a
// behavior change (every one of these values is always exactly 0 or 1).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// STATE-MACHINE CONVERSION (the big structural rewrite)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Upstream's real loop() is one giant nest of blocking `while`/`for` loops
// around `if (gb.update()) { ... }` (placement: `for(p) { while(b>=0) {
// if(gb.update()){...} } }`; then `while(playing) { for(p) { for(steps) {
// while(waiting){if(gb.update()){...}} } while(waiting_for_shot){
// if(gb.update()){...}} } }`) - converted here into an explicit state
// machine (`SHIP_STATE_TITLE/PLACE/ANIM/SHOOT`), matching the same
// "blocking loop -> explicit resumable state" treatment gamePong.c's own
// header comment documents for `gb.titleScreen()`. Every real local
// variable that used to live on the call stack across loop iterations
// (`p`, `b`, `cur_x`, `cur_y`, `boat_rot`, `steps`, the per-turn anim
// counters) became a persistent global instead (`shipP`/`shipB`/
// `shipCurX`/`shipCurY`/`shipBoatRot`/`shipAnimSteps`/...), advanced once
// per real `gbUpdate()` tick by button presses exactly the way upstream's
// own nested `while(gb.update())` loops were themselves advanced once per
// real Arduino `loop()` call - the two are behaviorally identical, just
// with the call stack traded for global state. The always-true `while (b
// >= 0)` loop condition upstream relies on (byte `b` never actually goes
// negative - termination is entirely via an internal `break`) needed no
// special handling here: it's just an explicit `if (shipB == 0) { ...
// transition ...; return; } else shipB = shipB - 1;` instead.
//
// Two subtleties were preserved deliberately rather than simplified away,
// because they produce genuine, reachable real-hardware behavior:
//
// 1. Upstream's own `title_screen()` (played from BOTH the initial
//    `setup()` AND a mid-game Button-C press) is a real BLOCKING call that
//    shows the splash and waits for A, then returns control to the exact
//    same point in the exact same nested loop it was called from - i.e. on
//    real hardware, Button C mid-game is a "pause and show the splash,
//    resume exactly where you left off" gesture, NOT a quit/reset. Ported
//    faithfully via `shipReturnState` (remembers which of PLACE/ANIM/SHOOT
//    to resume into) rather than "fixing" it into an actual quit - the
//    shared cartridge-level Start-button quit-confirmation dialog
//    (wired centrally in portVircon32.c) is the real way back to the menu;
//    this game's own Button C never touches that at all, exactly like
//    upstream.
// 2. Upstream's own game-over handling has NO explicit "you win, press
//    anything to restart" screen at all: `playing` only flips false deep
//    inside `update_game_over_anim()` once its own frame counter exceeds
//    41 (rendering the sliding "GAME OVER" banner for ~2.1 real seconds at
//    20fps) - checked ONLY at the top of the per-player `for` loop's next
//    iteration. Since a human needs 2-3 real Button-A presses to click
//    through the anim phase's own 3 steps, it's genuinely possible (a fast
//    player) for the OTHER player to still get one more full turn before
//    the game notices `playing == false` and Arduino's own `loop()`
//    re-invocation naturally restarts everything via a fresh
//    `reset_game()` call - straight back to boat placement, no title
//    screen shown. This emergent, timing-dependent behavior is reproduced
//    here as-is (not hard-coded into "game over -> immediate restart"):
//    `shipUpdateAnimPhase()`'s own step-3 transition checks `shipPlaying`
//    at exactly the same logical point upstream does (after this player's
//    own anim+shoot turn fully resolves, before deciding whether to hand
//    the next player a turn or restart), using the same real per-frame
//    `shipGameOverAnimFc` accumulation and the same real button-press-gated
//    step advancement - so the same "bonus turn if you clicked through
//    fast enough" quirk can occur here too, exactly as on real hardware.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// REAL EEPROM CHECK - genuinely came back negative for this game
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// This game was picked specifically because it ships a real
// `shipwreck.ino.eep` file upstream, expected to be this project's first
// real EEPROM consumer. Checked directly rather than assumed: grepping the
// entire upstream source (shipwreck.ino/functions.ino/todo.ino - the
// latter two are effectively empty, a blank line and a comment-only to-do
// list respectively) for "EEPROM" found ZERO matches - this game never
// calls `EEPROM.read()`/`write()`/`update()` anywhere. The shipped `.eep`
// file itself was inspected too: it's exactly `:00000001FF` - a single
// Intel-HEX "end of file" record with no data records at all, i.e. the
// default empty stub the Arduino/avr-gcc toolchain writes for EVERY sketch
// regardless of whether it touches EEPROM, not real save data. So despite
// this project's own CLAUDE.md describing shipwrek as "a natural first
// EEPROM consumer," the real source has nothing to wire up - the
// `eeprom_*()` primitives (`eepromShim.h`) are correctly left uncalled
// here, matching what upstream actually does (nothing), not what its
// filename made it look like it might do. No high score or placement
// layout is persisted; every game starts fresh from the title screen.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// SHIM PRIMITIVES USED
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// - **`gb.popup(text, duration)`** - this game leans on it heavily (9 real
//   call sites: "Can't overlap boats", "Already shot there!", "HIT!!!",
//   "Miss...", and one "<Boat> sunk!" per boat type) - not a cosmetic
//   nice-to-have here, a real, load-bearing part of the game's feedback
//   loop. Every call site here calls `gbPopup(text, duration)` directly
//   (the exact same real upstream durations); `gbPopup()` in
//   `gamebuinoShim.h`/`.c` is a direct port of real `Gamebuino::popup()`/
//   `updatePopup()` and auto-draws itself, real-hardware-accurate
//   slide-in animation included, on top of everything else already drawn
//   that frame.
// - **`gb.display.println(...)` (and the bare `gb.display.println()`
//   line-break form) has no direct one-call equivalent** - only
//   `gbPrintString()`/`gbPrintNumber()` (no auto-newline) exist. Handled
//   locally with a tiny `shipNewline()` helper (advances `gbCursorY` by
//   one real font cell and resets `gbCursorX` to 0, mirroring
//   `gbPrintString()`'s own internal `'\n'` handling exactly) - used by
//   `shipPrintInZone()`/`shipPrintInZoneWithNumber()` and directly
//   wherever upstream calls bare `println()`. This is a trivial, low-risk
//   local helper (not a design decision worth debating), but is flagged
//   here anyway since `println()` is a real, named upstream API this shim
//   doesn't expose as a single call.
//
// Neither of the above rises to "large missing subsystem" (an on-screen
// keyboard is this project's own already-documented, deliberate scope
// limit) - both are small.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// OTHER REAL QUIRKS FOUND, PRESERVED (not "fixed") - fidelity to upstream
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
// - Real single-arg `GRAY` (the shim's own `GB_GRAY`, a dithered checkerboard
//   color) is used exactly where upstream uses it: both cloud layers' own
//   back/shadow pass, own-boat overlays in `draw_boats()`, sunk-own-boat
//   reveal in `draw_shots()`, the boat's own waterline-mask band, and the
//   SHOOT-phase aim-reticle crosshair.
// - `shipUpdateClouds()`'s own real 3-layer bitmap technique (a GRAY
//   "shadow" cloud layer, THEN a WHITE mask cloud silhouette, THEN a BLACK
//   outline on top, all at the same x position) is exactly the "fill/mask
//   before an outline bitmap" pattern this port's own instructions
//   specifically warn about - all three layers were restored and preserved
//   in upstream's own exact order; dropping the WHITE mask layer would let
//   whatever's already drawn underneath bleed through the cloud silhouette.
// - `shipUpdateBoat()`'s own real `drawBitmap(10, ..., logo)` call has NO
//   explicit `setColor()` of its own immediately before it - it relies
//   entirely on whatever color the immediately-preceding
//   `shipUpdateClouds()` call left set (which always ends by explicitly
//   setting BLACK right before its own final two bitmap draws) - a real,
//   deterministic (not ambiguous) implicit-color-carryover quirk, since
//   this port calls the two functions back-to-back in the same fixed
//   order upstream does. Preserved exactly rather than "helpfully" adding
//   a redundant `gbSetColor()` upstream itself never has.
// - `shipUpdateSinkAnim()` runs unconditionally every frame (not gated by
//   `shipSinking`, only its OWN internal body is gated) directly after
//   `shipUpdateBoat()` already drew the same `shipLogo` bitmap once this
//   same frame at a slightly different y (before vs. after that frame's
//   own possible `shipBoatAnimY` increment) - upstream's own real
//   `update_boat()` + `update_sink_anim()` pairing does this too, so once
//   sinking starts, a handful of frames genuinely draw the ship bitmap
//   TWICE (at two adjacent y offsets) before the waterline-mask fillRect
//   papers back over both. A real, minor upstream double-draw quirk,
//   preserved as-is rather than de-duplicated.
// - `sfx()` is a direct, byte-for-byte port of upstream's own real
//   `sfx(fxno,channel)` - `shipSfx()` calls the shim's own real
//   tracker-engine primitives (`gbSoundCommand()` for volume/waveform/
//   slide/arpeggio, `gbPlayNoteChannel()` for the note itself), matching
//   upstream's own exact call order/argument shape one-for-one.
//   `shipSoundFx[2][8]` is upstream's own real `soundfx[2][8]` table
//   verified byte-for-byte. All 3 real call sites (sunk, hit, launch) are
//   restored with upstream's own exact fxno/channel arguments (channel
//   always 0, matching upstream).
// - `draw_shots()`'s own inner-block `byte x, y; bool dir;` locals (used
//   right inside a function whose OUTER loop already uses `x`/`y` as loop
//   variables) were renamed to `bx`/`by`/`bdir` here defensively, purely
//   to avoid depending on an unverified corner case of this dialect's own
//   block-scoping/shadowing rules - not an upstream behavior change.
// - The many `uselessN` globals (1 through 36, all dead - never read
//   anywhere) and the unused `sinking_anim_start`/`arrow_step_duration`
//   locals were dropped outright, matching gameConduit.c's own precedent
//   for dropping a real, provably-dead upstream debug leftover
//   (`arrow_step_duration`'s single value, 10, is inlined directly at its
//   one real use site instead).
// - `p_name[2][9]`/`boat_name[5][9]` (real mutable/fixed name tables) were
//   ported as small `shipPName(p)`/`shipBoatNameFor(b)` helper functions
//   returning a fixed string literal per index via if/else, rather than a
//   literal 2D string array - this game never actually renames players
//   (no on-screen keyboard - an already-documented scope limit), so
//   nothing is lost, and it sidesteps ever needing to confirm this
//   dialect's own nested string-array initializer syntax against a case
//   this project hadn't already proven elsewhere.
