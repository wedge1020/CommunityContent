// World's Hardest Game (Sorunome, license: none specified -
// github.com/Sorunome/Worlds-Hardest-Game-Gamebuino), the same author as
// this project's already-ported gameBlockdude.c. A Gamebuino port of the
// well-known Flash game: walk a small square through 22 real bundled
// levels, dodging patrolling black "ball" enemies (rectangles moving back
// and forth along fixed point-to-point patrol paths), collecting every
// coin in the level, then reaching the level's own goal-tile zone to
// advance. Touching an enemy resets you to your most recent checkpoint
// (not necessarily the level start - see the checkpoint/save-point system
// below) and increments a visible "tries" counter.
//
// Every real `gb.x.y(...)` call site was mechanically rewritten to a plain
// `gbY(...)` function call (this dialect has no classes/methods - see
// gamePong.c's own header comment for the full reasoning). Every global/
// function got a `whg`-prefixed name (this cartridge has no linker - every
// game shares one flat global namespace). `byte` became `int` throughout
// (see avrCompat.h). `BLACK`/`WHITE`/`NOROT`/`NOFLIP` have no equivalent
// named constants anywhere in this project (every other ported game just
// uses the literal 0/1 values directly - confirmed by grepping the whole
// src/ tree) - ported the same way: `BLACK`->1, `WHITE`->0, `NOROT`->0,
// `NOFLIP`->0 at each real call site.
//
// STRUCTS INSTEAD OF CLASSES: upstream's own real `Coin`/`Enemy` C++
// classes (heap-allocated via `new` into `Coin *coins[70]`/
// `Enemy *enemies[45]` pointer arrays, freed with `delete` in
// `destroyMap()`) were flattened into plain `WhgCoin`/`WhgEnemy` structs
// plus fixed `WhgCoin[70] whgCoins`/`WhgEnemy[45] whgEnemies` arrays - the
// same "no dynamic allocation anywhere in this project's ported games"
// treatment already established in gameBlockdude.c's own header comment.
// `whgNumCoins`/`whgNumEnemies` simply reset to 0 at the start of every
// `whgLoadMap()` call instead of upstream's own explicit `delete` loop -
// exactly equivalent in observable behavior, since every reader of
// `whgCoins[]`/`whgEnemies[]` everywhere in this file only ever iterates
// `0..whgNumCoins/Enemies-1`. Upstream's `Enemy::nextPoint` field is
// declared and initialized but never actually read or written anywhere
// else in the real class (dead code in the original) - not reproduced
// here.
//
// REAL BITMAP ART PORTED: `checkers` (a 6x6 dithered boundary-wall
// texture), `logo` (the real 64x36 title-screen splash, shown via
// upstream's own `gb.titleScreen(logo)`), and `ok`/`ko` (the real 8x7
// level-complete/incomplete icons, upstream's own comment credits these
// as "from bub" - a different staged game in this project's own `more
// games/` tree) were all copied byte-for-byte into plain
// `int[N] whgXxxBitmap = { width, height, ... }` arrays (this dialect's
// own `int[N] name` array-declaration order) - the exact shape
// `gbDrawBitmap()` expects. Every one of upstream's own byte literals here
// was already `0x`-prefixed hex (or plain decimal for `ok`'s first byte,
// `0x2`) - no Arduino `B00000000`-style binary literals anywhere in this
// upstream source (grepped directly to confirm). No solid fill/mask layer
// is drawn underneath any of these upstream (confirmed by re-reading every
// real `gb.display.drawBitmap(...)` call site directly - none are preceded
// by a `setColor(GRAY)`+mask-bitmap pair or a plain fillRect), so none was
// needed here either - see gameFlappyBirdo.c's own header comment for the
// two real cases in this project where that assumption was wrong; checked
// for specifically here and confirmed not to apply.
//
// LEVEL DATA - MECHANICALLY REGENERATED, NOT HAND-TRANSCRIBED: upstream's
// real `levels.ino` encodes each of its 22 levels as one dense
// `const byte gamemapN[] PROGMEM` byte table (header: winTile,width,
// height; then width*height tile bytes; then an initial 2-byte spawn
// point; then a variable number of enemy-patrol/coin records, terminated
// by a reserved 0xFF byte), built almost entirely out of a parameterized
// `TILETOPX(x)` macro (`x*MAPTILESIZE+1`, MAPTILESIZE=6) rather than plain
// literals, with individual enemy patrol-point lists of wildly varying
// length (anywhere from 1 to 8 waypoints) wrapped across multiple source
// lines. Hand-transcribing ~4600 real data values across 22 arrays while
// manually evaluating every `TILETOPX(...)` call and getting every fixed-
// size `int[N]` array declaration's own N exactly right (this dialect
// requires an explicit, exact size - see VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md - there is
// no `int[] arr = {...}` size inference to fall back on) is exactly the
// kind of mechanical, error-prone-by-hand task a real upstream author
// would never have attempted manually either (hence the macro in the
// first place). Instead, a small verified Python script
// (parse the real `levels.ino` text directly, substitute
// MAPFLAGCOIN/ENEMY/END->253/254/255 and MAPTILESIZE->6, evaluate every
// `TILETOPX(x)` call to `x*6+1`, then flatten each level's own full
// comma-separated initializer list) produced every `whgMapN` array below
// byte-for-byte from the real source, with the resulting element count
// then cross-checked BY HAND against the real byte-layout arithmetic for
// two representative levels before trusting the rest: `whgMap1` (4 fixed-
// length enemies, no coins) = 3 header + 108 tiles + 2 spawn + 4*6 enemy
// bytes + 1 end = 138, and `whgMap3` (11 enemies with irregular 4/5-
// waypoint patrol lists, 1 coin) = 3 + 20 + 2 + 126 + 3 + 1 = 155 - both
// match the script's own independently-computed counts exactly.
// MAPFLAGCOIN/MAPFLAGENEMY/MAPFLAGEND (0xFD/0xFE/0xFF in the real source)
// are ported as WHG_MAPFLAGCOIN/ENEMY/END (253/254/255) below.
//
// A REAL, LOAD-BEARING PARSING QUIRK IN `whgLoadMap()`, PRESERVED
// EXACTLY: upstream's own real `loadMap()` while-loop does NOT explicitly
// skip over an enemy's own variable-length patrol-point list, or a coin's
// own y-coordinate byte, after building that entity - it relies entirely
// on every one of those interior data bytes failing to equal any of the
// three reserved flag values (253/254/255, real coordinate values in this
// game never get that large), so the *same* outer while-loop iteration
// harmlessly re-reads each one as a "flag" that matches neither the enemy
// nor coin branch, silently consuming it one byte at a time via the loop's
// own unconditional `i++`, until real bytes belonging to the NEXT entity
// record are reached. This is genuinely how the format is meant to work
// (there is no explicit patrol-list length anywhere in the data), not a
// bug - ported as an ordinary `while` loop with sequential `i = i + 1`
// statements, matching this exactly. One real deviation, made
// deliberately rather than by oversight: upstream's own C++ constructs
// the `Enemy` in a single expression, `new Enemy(pgm_read_byte(gamemap+
// (i++)), gamemap+i)` - whether the *second* argument (`gamemap+i`, meant
// to point just past the speed byte) is evaluated before or after the
// *first* argument's own `i++` side effect is unspecified evaluation
// order in C/C++, and this real upstream code silently depends on
// whichever order the actual avr-gcc build happened to choose. Rather
// than risk reproducing that same ambiguity in a different compiler's own
// unspecified order (and this dialect's own evaluation-order rules for
// nested-call arguments are not something this project has had reason to
// pin down elsewhere), this port resolves it deterministically with
// explicit sequential statements (read+advance the speed byte, THEN take
// the pointer) - matching the clearly-intended reading of the algorithm
// (the one that actually produces working, playable levels), not a
// behavior change.
//
// A REAL, GENUINELY MORE-VISIBLE-HERE-THAN-ON-REAL-HARDWARE EEPROM BUG,
// FOUND AND FIXED (not preserved - the same class of issue
// gameBlockdude.c's own header comment already documented once for this
// same author's own other game, and fixed there too): upstream's real
// `refreshLevelMenu()` reads one raw EEPROM byte per level (`byte done =
// EEPROM.read(curPick-1);`) and shows the "ok" checkmark icon whenever
// `done>0`. A genuinely never-written AVR EEPROM cell reads back as 255
// (0xFF, real hardware's own factory-erased state - see eepromShim.c's own
// header comment for why this shim deliberately matches that instead of
// defaulting to 0), and 255 > 0 is true - so on a completely fresh save,
// EVERY level showed as already completed, not just the specific "moves"
// nonsense-readout side effect Blockdude's own analogous bug caused (that
// game's own check was `moves>0` on a genuinely separate byte from its own
// "is it done" logic - checked directly, WHG's own single `done` byte
// here plays both roles at once, so this port's version of the bug was
// the more visible of the two: real hardware normally masks this with
// whatever residue happens to be sitting in a chip that's been used for
// other sketches before, but this shim's own per-game EEPROM slots are
// deterministically blank 0xFF the first time any save slot is ever
// claimed - see eepromShim.c - so this fired reliably, for every level,
// the first time this cartridge was ever run on a fresh save slot. Fixed
// in `whgDrawLevelMenu()`: the fresh-cell sentinel (255) is normalized
// back to 0 right after reading, matching this project's own established
// EEPROM convention - safe here since real upstream's own `eeprom_write_
// byte()` call site only ever writes a literal 1 for "done," never 255.
//
// TWO MORE REAL QUIRKS IN `whgUpdatePlay()`, BOTH TRACED DIRECTLY THROUGH
// UPSTREAM'S OWN `doTitleScreen()`/`doMainMenu()`/`loop()` AND PRESERVED:
// (1) `tries` (the on-screen death counter) is reset to 0 only inside
// upstream's real `doMainMenu()` (i.e. only when a level is freshly picked
// from the level-select menu) - NOT inside `loadMap()` itself. That means
// auto-advancing through several levels in a row without ever revisiting
// the level menu (beating one level's own goal loads the next one
// directly, in the same real function) keeps accumulating the SAME
// running `tries` total across all of them; only a fresh menu-driven level
// pick resets it. Ported as two distinct call sites below rather than one
// shared "start a level" helper: the level-menu Button-A handler resets
// `whgTries` itself before entering PLAY, while the win-and-advance path
// in `whgUpdatePlay()` calls `whgLoadMap()` directly, deliberately leaving
// `whgTries` untouched, exactly matching upstream.
// (2) Completing a level that ISN'T the last one calls upstream's own
// plain, non-blocking `loadMap()` - execution then falls straight through
// to `loop()`'s own trailing `if(gb.buttons.pressed(BTN_C)) doTitleScreen
// (false);` check in the very same tick. So on real hardware, finishing a
// level while still holding Button C yanks you straight to the level-
// select menu before you ever see a single frame of the level you just
// auto-advanced into - preserved verbatim below by NOT returning early
// after the non-final-level `whgLoadMap()` call, letting the same tick's
// own trailing Button-C check still run. Completing the genuinely LAST
// level instead calls upstream's own real *blocking* `doTitleScreen(false)`
// (which, given `doTitle=false`, actually lands directly on the level-
// select menu rather than the title screen - read carefully from the real
// do-while's own two-parameter dance, see below) - since that fully
// resolves before real `loop()` continues, this port's own equivalent
// (`whgBeginLevelMenu()`) DOES return immediately after, matching the
// "blocking call -> explicit state transition ends this tick" treatment
// used throughout this project (see gameBlockdude.c's own header comment
// for the same idea applied to its own nested blocking loops).
//
// STATE MACHINE: upstream's own real structure is `setup()` calling
// `doTitleScreen(true)` once, a real live-forever `loop()` for gameplay,
// and `doTitleScreen(byte doTitle)`'s own real do-while (`do{ destroyMap();
// if(doTitle){ titleScreen(...); ...settings...; } doTitle=true; }while(
// !doMainMenu());` - note `doTitle` is unconditionally forced true right
// after its own first use, every time). Reading this carefully (not just
// assuming "doTitleScreen" always shows the title) reveals THREE distinct
// real entry behaviors depending on the caller's own `doTitle` argument:
// boot (`doTitleScreen(true)`) shows the title screen, then the level
// menu; a Button-C press from the level menu itself re-enters the SAME
// do-while with `doTitle` already forced true from the previous pass, so
// it shows the title screen again; but Button-C mid-game or finishing the
// final level both call `doTitleScreen(false)` - `doTitle` starts false,
// so the very first do-while pass skips the title screen entirely and
// goes straight to the level menu (only a SUBSEQUENT Button-C press from
// there, if any, would show the title, since `doTitle` is forced true by
// then). Converted into an explicit `WhgState` enum (WHG_STATE_TITLE /
// WHG_STATE_LEVELMENU / WHG_STATE_PLAY) with three distinct transitions
// matching this exactly: TITLE -A-> LEVELMENU; LEVELMENU -C-> TITLE,
// -A-> PLAY (loads the picked level, resets `whgTries`); PLAY -C-> directly
// to LEVELMENU (title screen skipped, matching `doTitleScreen(false)`);
// finishing the last level -> directly to LEVELMENU too. Real Gamebuino's
// own `gb.titleScreen()` waits specifically for Button A - reused directly
// here as the dismiss gesture, matching gamePong.c's/gameBlockdude.c's own
// precedent, with `md_armInputAGate()` (already wired globally into this
// project's own dispatch loop) preventing the menu-launch A-press itself
// from bleeding into an instant title-screen dismissal. Real `gb.display.
// persistence`/`gb.battery.show` have no equivalent in this shim - dropped
// outright (purely cosmetic/an incremental-redraw optimization real
// hardware needed but this project's own "always fully redraw every real
// tick" convention doesn't - see gameBlockdude.c's own header comment for
// the same reasoning applied to its own real `persistence` usage).
// Upstream's own real `refreshLevelMenu()`'s "erase old moves display"
// `fillRect(0,24,48,5)` call is dead code inherited by copy-paste from
// this same author's own Blockdude (which DOES print a real moves count
// into that exact region) - WHG's own level menu never actually prints
// anything there, so nothing is ever drawn into that region here to need
// erasing in the first place, consistent with this project's own "no
// incremental erase needed, full redraw every tick" convention.
//
// `gb.setFrameRate(30)` IS A REAL, EXPLICIT UPSTREAM CALL (inside
// `doTitleScreen()`, guarded by its own `if(doTitle)` so it only actually
// executes once, on the very first real boot) - unlike gamePong.c (which
// never calls `setFrameRate()` at all and so runs at this shim's own
// 20fps default), this game deliberately overrides that default to 30fps
// for its ENTIRE session. Ported as a single `gbSetFrameRate(30)` call in
// `gameWhg_init()`.
//
// EEPROM: real `EEPROM.read(level)`/`EEPROM.write(level,1)` (a single
// plain byte per level - not the two-byte word Blockdude's own real move-
// counter needed) port directly to this shim's own `eeprom_read_byte()`/
// `eeprom_write_byte()`, one byte per level at addresses 0-21 (levels are
// 0-indexed internally), far under this shim's own 1024-byte-per-game
// EEPROM slot.
//
// A REAL DEAD-CODE BOUNDS CHECK THAT BECOMES LIVE (BUT STILL HARMLESS)
// ONCE PORTED: `getTileAtPos()`'s own real lower-bound guard
// (`playerY+yoffset<0`) can never actually fire on real hardware, since
// `playerX`/`playerY`/the offsets are all real unsigned `byte`s there -
// a byte "going negative" instead silently wraps to a huge positive value,
// which the function's OWN SEPARATE upper-bound guard
// (`>= mapHeight*MAPTILESIZE`) then reliably catches instead (every real
// map's own `mapHeight*MAPTILESIZE` is far smaller than 255). This shim's
// `whgPlayerX`/`whgPlayerY` are plain signed `int`s (see avrCompat.h - no
// narrower integer types exist in this dialect), so walking off the top/
// left edge of a level genuinely can produce a negative value here, and
// the lower-bound guard now actually fires for real - but it returns the
// exact same result (0, "blocked") the upper-bound guard would otherwise
// have caught via wraparound on real hardware, so this is not a behavior
// change, just a different one of two redundant guards doing the catching.
//
// `random()`/`gb.pickRandomSeed()` are never called anywhere in this real
// upstream source (grepped directly to confirm) - every enemy's own
// movement is a fully deterministic, fixed point-to-point patrol path
// baked into the level data itself, not randomized - so no `arand()`/
// `gbPickRandomSeed()` port was needed here at all, matching
// gameBlockdude.c's own same finding for its own upstream source.
//
// Upstream's own real `Coin::draw()` calls
// `gb.display.drawRoundRect(drawX,drawY,4,4,1)` (a rounded-corner outline
// rectangle, 1px corner radius), a direct port of real `Display::
// drawRoundRect()` provided by `gbDrawRoundRect()` in `gamebuinoShim.h`/
// `.c` - `whgCoinDraw()` calls `gbDrawRoundRect(drawX,drawY,4,4,1)`
// directly, matching upstream's own real call exactly.
