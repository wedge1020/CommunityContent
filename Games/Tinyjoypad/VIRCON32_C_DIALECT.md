# The Vircon32 C Dialect

A reference for the C language as accepted by the Vircon32 C compiler, written to guide
the Box2D port. It consolidates the official *Guide for the C compiler* (2023) **and
corrects it** against the actual compiler source shipped in this repo
(`ComputerSoftware/DevelopmentTools/CCompiler`, dated 2024–2025) and the standard
library headers (`.../Data/include`, dated 2024–2025).

> **Why the correction matters.** The PDF guide is from 2023-03-11 (compiler 23.3.7).
> The toolchain checked out here is 2+ years newer and several features the guide lists
> as *"not supported"* or *"planned for the future"* now work — most importantly
> **function pointers** and **function-like macros**. Everything below was verified
> against the current source; where the guide is now wrong this document says so
> explicitly. **Trust this file over the PDF.**
>
> **Update — now empirically verified.** The key claims below have since been confirmed
> by *running the actual compiler binary* (`compile.exe` **v26.04.24**) and the emulator,
> not just reading source. See §15 for the probe results and the proven porting idiom.

## 1. The big picture

Vircon32 is a fantasy 32-bit console. Its CPU has no byte addressing: **the smallest unit
of memory is a 32-bit word**, and *every* type is exactly one word (32 bits). This single
fact drives most of the dialect's differences from standard C.

The toolchain is a 3-stage pipeline, with **no linker**:

```
  compile.exe  →  .asm   (C → assembly)
  assemble.exe →  .vbin  (assembly → binary)
  packrom.exe  →  .v32   (binary + textures + sounds → cartridge ROM)
```

Because there is no linker, **a program is a single translation unit**: the one `.c` file
passed to `compile.exe`, plus everything it `#include`s (headers carry full
implementations, not just prototypes). For Box2D this means all ~38 `.c` files must be
funnelled into one compilation through includes. See §11.

---

## 2. Types

### Primitive types — only four, all 32-bit

| Type    | Size      | Notes                                              |
|---------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `int`   | 1 word    | 32-bit **signed** integer. No unsigned variant.    |
| `float` | 1 word    | 32-bit IEEE-style float (single precision).        |
| `bool`  | 1 word    | `true` = 1, `false` = 0.                            |
| `void`  | —         | Absence of type; only for return types and pointers.|

**There are still only these four *distinct* widths — everything is one 32-bit word.**
`signed`/`unsigned` are not keywords at all and remain unusable.

> **CORRECTION (2026-07-05, probe p12).** As of **v26.04.24** the compiler *does* accept
> `char`, `short`, `long`, and `double` — they are treated internally as `int`/`float`
> respectively (per the DevTools Readme changelog, empirically confirmed: p12 compiles
> **and** assembles clean). Earlier text here said they were *rejected by the type checker*;
> that was true of an older binary but is **now false**. IMPORTANT: this buys **source
> compatibility only, not capability** — `char`/`short`/`long` are still full 32-bit words
> (no byte packing, no extra range), and `double` is still single precision (no extra bits).
> So you may leave upstream `char`/`double` in place rather than editing them out, but every
> *architectural* constraint (word-addressed `sizeof`, no 64-bit int, float underflow < ~1e-6)
> is unchanged. Prefer plain `int`/`float` in new port code; use the aliases only to reduce
> churn when copying upstream verbatim.

Consequences that bite hard when porting standard C:
- No 64-bit integer. `int64_t`/`uint64_t` cannot be represented in one word.
- No unsigned arithmetic, no unsigned wraparound semantics, no logical-vs-arithmetic
  distinction except shifts (see §6).
- A "character" is just an `int`. String literals are `int[]`, one word per character.

### Derived types: pointers and arrays

Pointers and arrays work, and can be nested arbitrarily: `int*`, `void**`,
`float[3][5]`, `void*[4]`. You may make pointers to `void`, but **not arrays of `void`**
(there are no void values).

**Type/name syntax is non-standard and always `<type> <name>`.** The type is written as a
self-contained unit on the left, never wrapped around the name:

```c
// standard C        →  Vircon32 C
int *p, q;           //  int* p, q;   ← and note: BOTH are int* here (see §3)
int arr[10];         //  int[10] arr;
int (*fp)(int);      //  REJECTED here - see §2 function pointers below for the real syntax
typedef int (*T)[5]; //  typedef int[5]* T;   ← read right-to-left
```

Declaring an array the standard way (`int arr[10];`) is a **compile error**.

### Function pointers — **SUPPORTED**, but only via the typedef'd-signature form

The 2023 guide says function pointers are "planned for next versions." **They exist in the
current compiler and are proven working**, not just theoretically present in source - both
`crisp-game-lib-portable-vircon32` (its `onResetGame`/`onSaveData` hooks) and
`gamebuino_classic_vircon32` (its entire menu/game-dispatch table, `GameFunc* init`/`update`/
`onResume` in `menu.h`, driving all ~90 games via real `&function` assignments in
`menuGameList.c`'s own `addGame()` calls) rely on real function pointers as load-bearing,
everyday infrastructure, not an edge case.

**The raw, standard-C inline declaration syntax is rejected** - `int (*fp)(int);` (the literal
form the type/name table above once listed as if it worked) fails to compile
(`fatal error: expected a type`), for a plain parameter, a global, and a struct field alike.
This is not "function pointers don't work" - it's the same `<type> <name>` rule §2's array
syntax already applies (`int[10] arr;`, not `int arr[10];`), extended to function types: **the
function *signature* must be `typedef`'d into a named type first, and variables of that type
declared as `Name* var`**:

```c
// standard C                    →  Vircon32 C
int (*fp)(int);                     typedef int(int) FpType;   // typedef the SIGNATURE first
                                     FpType* fp;                // then declare the pointer

fp = some_function;                 fp = &some_function;        // assignment needs & explicitly
int r = fp(5);                      int r = fp(5);               // calling looks the same
```

Real, in-repo examples of this idiom: `menu.h`'s `typedef void(void) GameFunc;` +
`GameFunc* init;`/`GameFunc* update;`, and `cglp.h`'s `typedef void(void) UpdateFunc;` /
`typedef void(Game*) ResetGameFunc;` + `ResetGameFunc* onResetGame;`, assigned as
`onSaveData = &saveHighScoresToCard;` in `portVircon32.c`.

The type checker validates argument counts/types against the pointed-to signature
(`CNodes.cpp`, `CheckNodes.cpp`, `CheckUnaryOperations.cpp`), and a function pointer "can only
be dereferenced when calling it" — i.e. you use `fp()` or `(*fp)()`, you don't take `**fp` etc.

This is decisive for the Box2D port: Box2D's callbacks (`b2*Fcn`, query/raycast callbacks,
the task system's `b2TaskCallback`) depend on function pointers and can be ported more or
less directly instead of being rewritten - just through the typedef'd form above, not the
raw inline syntax.

**A real, previously-published false negative to watch for**: a `gameCruiser.c` porting
agent (`gamebuino_classic_vircon32`) tried exactly the rejected raw inline form quoted above,
hit the real compile error, and concluded outright that function pointers don't work on this
platform at all - without ever trying the typedef'd form, despite that same project's own
`menu.h` already using it successfully for every one of its ~90 games. Fixed in that
project's own `CLAUDE.md`/`gameCruiser.c` once checked directly against real, working sibling
code rather than trusted from the agent's own report. Worth remembering as a concrete example
of why "it didn't compile with the syntax I tried" isn't the same claim as "it isn't
supported" on this dialect - check for a `<type> <name>`-style transformed form before
concluding a whole language feature is absent.

### `struct`, `union`, `enum`, `typedef`

- Declaring a `struct`/`union`/`enum` **declares a type**, C++-style — you do **not** need
  `typedef`, and the tag name *is* the type name:
  ```c
  struct Point { int x, y; };
  Point p;            // no 'struct' keyword needed at use
  ```
- Structs/unions may contain other structs/unions, and may contain **themselves only
  through pointers** (as in standard C).
- **`union` works, but only as a NAMED type** (re-probed 2026-07-18, correcting p11's
  original verdict): `union U { int x; float y; };` then `U u;` compiles with true
  overlaid storage (`sizeof` = largest member, members alias the same word).
  **Anonymous inline union members fail** — `struct S { union { int x; float y; } u; };`
  errors with "expected a type". Declare the union as a named type first.
- **No bit-fields.** Not supported, no plans to add. (Box2D's flag fields are plain `int`
  masks anyway, so this is rarely an issue — but anything relying on `:1` widths must be
  rewritten.)
- `enum`: integer constants, auto-incrementing from 0 (or from an assigned value).
  Implicitly convert **enum → int**, but **not int → enum** (stricter than standard C).
- `typedef` works, using the same `<type> <name>` ordering: `typedef int[5]* ptr_to_array;`

### `const` — **SUPPORTED** (guide is out of date)

The guide lists `const` as unsupported. The current parser handles it
(`VirconCParser.cpp`: `IsConst`/`ParsedType->IsConst`). `static`, `volatile`, `register`
remain unsupported.

### `extern` — **SUPPORTED** (not in guide)

The current parser supports `extern` variable declarations
(`ParseExternVariableList`). This allows forward-declaring a global without defining it.
Note: this does **not** introduce a linker — the program is still one translation unit —
but it helps when arranging includes so headers can reference globals defined later.

---

## 3. Variables

- Declared `<type> <name>` with optional initializer: `float Speed = 2.5;`
- **Multiple declarations share the full type, including pointer-ness.** In
  `int* a, b, c;` **all three are `int*`** — unlike standard C where only `a` would be a
  pointer. This is a frequent porting trap.
- **Initializer lists** for arrays/structs work and nest: `Point[3] tri = {{0,0},{1,0},{1,1}};`
- A string literal can initialize an `int[]`: `int[10] Text = "Hello";` (adds a trailing 0).

### Three storage classes
- **Local** — declared in a function body, lives on the stack.
- **Global** — declared at file scope, fixed address.
- **`embedded`** — Vircon32-specific. A global array whose contents are read from a file
  **at compile time** and stored in the **cartridge ROM** (read-only) instead of RAM:
  ```c
  embedded int[200][100] TileMap = "GameData\\LevelMap.bin";
  ```
  The file size must exactly equal the array size *in bytes* (words × 4). Globals only —
  never inside a function. Use this for large read-only data (lookup tables, level data).

---

## 4. Functions

- Defined as in standard C but with this dialect's type notation:
  `int AddValues( int a, int b ) { return a + b; }`
- **Parameters and return values must be exactly one word (32 bits).** You **cannot pass or
  return a `struct`/`union`/array by value** unless its size is a single word. Pass a
  **pointer** instead. This is the single most pervasive rewrite when porting C that passes
  small structs by value (e.g. Box2D's `b2Vec2`, `b2Transform`, `b2Rot` are all passed and
  returned by value upstream and must be reworked to pointers — or kept ≤1 word, which
  `b2Vec2` is *not*: it's two floats = two words).
  *Verified against the current compiler's calling convention (not just the guide):* the
  emitter passes **each argument in a single register** (`R0`, `R1`, …) and returns the
  value in **`R0`** (`EmitExpressionNodes.cpp`, `EmitNonExpressionNodes.cpp`). There is no
  stack-copy / hidden-return-pointer (sret) path for aggregates, so the restriction is real
  and current. (Multi-word *assignment* between variables *is* supported via a block copy —
  it's only the function boundary that's one-word.)
- Arrays **decay to pointers** as parameters, as usual: `int SumValues(int* v, int n)`.
- **No variadics / no `...`.** `printf`-style functions are impossible. Any logging or
  assert that uses `...` must be removed or replaced with fixed-arity helpers.
- The `main` function takes **no arguments and returns void**: `void main() { ... }`
  (there is no OS to pass argc/argv or receive an exit code).

---

## 5. The `b2Vec2`-sized-return problem (call it out early)

Because of §4's one-word rule, the most mechanical and most voluminous part of the Box2D
port is converting by-value struct math (`b2Vec2`, `b2Rot`, `b2Transform`, `b2Mat22`,
`b2AABB`…) so it never crosses a function boundary by value. Options: pass pointers to
in/out structs, or inline the math via macros (function-like macros now exist — see §8).
Plan for this; it touches `math_functions.h` and nearly every call site.

---

## 6. Expressions and operators

- Same operators, precedence, and associativity as standard C, **except**:
  - **No ternary `a ? b : c`.** Rewrite as `if/else`.
  - **No comma operator `a, b`.** (Commas in declarations/calls are fine; the *operator* is
    not.)
- **Right shift `>>` is a *logical* shift** (zero-fill), not arithmetic. `>>=` likewise.
  Code that relies on sign-extending right shift of negatives will behave differently.
- `sizeof(x)` returns the size **in 32-bit words**, not bytes. `sizeof(int)` is `1`,
  `sizeof(int[2][5])` is `10`. **This permeates memory code — see §7.**
- Explicit casts work: `float x = 5.0 / (int)2.5;` (the `(int)` truncates 2.5 → 2).

---

## 7. Word-addressed memory — the rule to internalize

Everything is counted in **words, not bytes**:
- `sizeof` returns words.
- Pointer arithmetic steps by words (one `int*` increment moves one word = the next `int`).
- The standard-library block functions take **sizes in words**:
  `memset(dst, value, sizeWords)`, `memcpy(dst, src, sizeWords)`,
  `memcmp(a, b, sizeWords)` (see `misc.h`).

**The safe rule:** never hardcode a byte count, and never multiply by a `sizeof(char)`/4.
Always derive sizes from `sizeof(T)`. Then `memcpy(d, s, sizeof(T))` stays correct because
*both* `sizeof` and `memcpy` speak words. Code that assumes `sizeof` is bytes (e.g.
`n * 4`, `count * sizeof(char)`, hand-rolled byte offsets, serialization with byte
strides) **breaks** and must be rewritten in word terms.

---

## 8. The preprocessor (current capabilities)

Supported directives (verified in `VirconCPreprocessor.cpp` dispatch):

| Directive                        | Status            | Notes |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `#include "path"`                | ✅                | **Quotes only**; `#include <path>` is rejected. Path is a normal string — escape `\` as `\\`. Searches the compiler `include/` dir first, then the source dir. Max nesting depth 20. |
| `#define` object-like macro      | ✅                | |
| `#define` **function-like macro**| ✅ **(new!)**     | Guide says unsupported; current compiler supports `#define MAX(a,b) ...`. The `(` must immediately follow the name with no space. |
| `#undef`                         | ✅                | |
| `#ifdef` / `#ifndef`             | ✅                | |
| `#else` / `#endif`               | ✅                | |
| `#error` / `#warning`            | ✅                | |
| `#if` / `#elif`                  | ❌                | Still not supported. Only `#ifdef`/`#ifndef` conditionals. |
| `#` (stringize) / `##` (paste)   | ❌                | A `#` inside a macro body is a hard error ("definitions cannot contain the hash symbol"). |
| `#line`, `#pragma`, `#assert`    | ❌                | |
| `__FILE__`, `__LINE__`, `__DATE__`, `__TIME__`, `__func__` | ❌ | These predefined macros do not exist. |

Porting implications for Box2D:
- Box2D's config relies on `#if`/`#elif`/`defined()` (e.g. `B2_SIMD`, platform branches).
  These must be flattened to `#ifdef`/`#ifndef` or pre-resolved by hand.
- Macros using `##`/`#` (token pasting for generated names, stringized asserts) must be
  rewritten.
- "Not-compiled" regions are still **lexed** (read at a basic level), so even disabled code
  must be lexically valid (balanced strings/numbers).

---

## 9. Embedding assembly

`asm { "instr" ... }` blocks are allowed **inside function bodies** (gcc-string style). A C
variable can be referenced as `{name}` inside an instruction, but: **only plain names** (no
expressions, no array/member access) and **at most one variable per instruction** (a CPU
constraint). The entire Vircon32 standard library is built this way — every math/memory
primitive is a tiny `asm` wrapper (see §10).

### 9.1 Statement-level `asm` intrinsics (probe p13, 2026-07-06 — compiled clean)

Verified against the compiler source (`EmitAssemblyBlock`,
`EmitNonExpressionNodes.cpp:844`) and the emitted `.asm` of
`probes/p13_asm_intrinsics.c`:

- **`{var}` works in BOTH operand positions.** The compiler does a *textual*
  substitution of the variable's memory address (`[BP+n]` for locals/params,
  `[global_x]` for globals), so `"mov R0, {x}"` (read) **and** `"mov {x}, R0"`
  (write-back) both compile. This makes in-place scalar intrinsics possible:
  ```c
  float ni = cp_normalImpulse + impulse;   // plain LOCAL (see next bullet)
  asm { "mov R0, {ni}"  "fmax R0, 0.0"  "mov {ni}, R0" }   // 3 instructions
  ```
- **Copy struct members to a local first** — `{p->field}` / `{arr[i]}` do not
  resolve (the interpolator takes a resolved plain variable only).
- **Float immediates are legal instruction operands**: `fmax R0, 0.0`,
  `fadd R0, 1.570796`, `flt R0, 0.000000` all compile (but the §15.3 sub-1e-6
  underflow applies to *these literals too* — same lexer).
- **Clobber rule**: the compiler spills everything to memory between C
  statements, so R0 is free to clobber inside a statement-level `asm` block;
  `push`/`pop` any other register you touch (the `math.h` bodies model this).
  R11/R12/R13 are CR/SR/DR — the string-op registers — avoid unless using
  MOVS/SETS/CMPS.
- **Why bother:** the compiler never inlines, so a `fmax()` *call* costs ~28
  instructions end-to-end vs 3 for the asm form (§16). Use intrinsics only in
  profiler-proven hot paths; keep the readable function forms everywhere else.
- STATUS: p13 verified by compilation + reading the emitted assembly; give it
  one green emulator run before shipping hot-path code built on the write-back
  form.

---

## 10. The standard library (what actually ships)

Headers live in `ComputerSoftware/DevelopmentTools/Data/include/`. They are **full
implementations** (no linker, remember), guarded by include guards, and mostly thin `asm`
wrappers over CPU opcodes. This is the *entire* hosted surface — there is no file I/O, no
OS, no `stdio`/`stdlib`/`stdint`/`assert`/`float.h` as standard C knows them.

| Header        | Provides |
|---------------|----------|
| `math.h`      | `fmod`; `min`/`max`/`abs` (int); `fmin`/`fmax`/`fabs`; `floor`/`ceil`/`round`; `sin`/`cos`/`tan`/`asin`/`acos`/`atan2`; `sqrt`/`pow`/`exp`/`log`. Constants `pi`, `INT_MIN`, `INT_MAX`. Angles in radians. **No `double` versions** — everything is `float`. Several functions trigger a *hardware error* on out-of-domain input (e.g. `sqrt(x<0)`, `log(x<=0)`, `tan` at cos=0, `asin/acos` with \|x\|>1, `atan2(0,0)`). |
| `misc.h`      | `memset`/`memcpy`/`memcmp` (**sizes in words**); **dynamic memory: `malloc`/`calloc`/`realloc`/`free`** (a real doubly-linked-list allocator); `rand`/`srand`; `exit` (halts CPU). |
| `string.h`    | character classification (`isdigit`, `isalpha`, …), string building/comparison, number→string conversion. Strings are `int[]`. |
| `input.h`     | gamepad state. |
| `video.h`     | GPU: textures, regions, drawing to screen. |
| `audio.h`     | SPU: sound playback. |
| `time.h`      | timing / frame pacing. |
| `memcard.h`   | save/load to memory card. |

### Dynamic memory specifics (important for Box2D's allocators)
- `malloc`/`calloc`/`realloc`/`free` exist and behave normally — Box2D's `b2Alloc`/`b2Free`
  can map straight onto them.
- **Default heap is small.** `misc.h` sets `malloc_start_address = 1 MWord`,
  `malloc_end_address = 3 MWord − 1` — i.e. ~2 MB of a 4 MB RAM, reserving the first MWord
  for globals and the last for the stack. You can **enlarge the heap by writing
  `malloc_start_address`/`malloc_end_address` before the first `malloc` call** (changes
  after first use are ignored). Box2D worlds with many bodies will likely need this tuned.
- Allocation metadata (`malloc_block`) is counted in words; `sizeof` consistency holds.

---

## 11. Program structure & build (no linker)

- One translation unit. To use code from another file you **`#include` the whole file**
  (implementation included), not just a prototype header. Forward/partial declarations are
  allowed for ordering, but final code must all be present in the single compilation.
- For Box2D (~38 `.c` + headers) the practical pattern is an **amalgamation**: a single
  `main`/unit `.c` that `#include`s every Box2D `.c` in dependency order, with include
  guards preventing double inclusion, compiled in one shot. Watch for duplicate
  `static`-less globals and name collisions, since everything shares one namespace.
- The compiler emits only `.asm`; you then run `assemble.exe` and `packrom.exe`.
- CLI mirrors gcc: `compile.exe [options] file`. Options: `--help`, `--version`,
  `-o <file>`, `-b` (compile as BIOS), `-v` (verbose), `-c` (compile only, no assemble),
  `-w`/`-Wall`. `-s`, `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O3` are accepted but **ignored** (the compiler does
  little optimization — expect to hand-optimize hot paths).

---

## 12. Other gotchas

- **`NULL == -1`, not 0.** Memory address 0 is valid on Vircon32, so the null pointer is
  `-1`. `if(ptr)` still tests "ptr != NULL" correctly, and normal NULL idioms work — but
  do **not** assume a zeroed buffer (`calloc`, `memset(...,0,...)`) yields NULL pointers,
  and do not `memset` a pointer region to 0 expecting nulls.
- **No scientific float notation.** `1.35e-7` is not accepted; write it out longhand.
- **Charset is Windows Latin-1 / CP1252, not Unicode.** Source and the BIOS font are
  CP1252 (256 chars). Keep source ASCII to be safe.
- **First-error-only.** The compiler typically stops at the first error rather than
  reporting many at once.

---

## 13. Box2D collision map (grounded in the cloned `box2d/` source)

Counts below are raw grep hits across `src/ include/ shared/` of the checked-out Box2D v3,
to size each problem. Box2D v3 is **C (C17)**, which helps, but it leans on exactly the
features this dialect lacks.

| Box2D construct | Hits | Dialect status | Port action |
|-----------------|------|----------------|-------------|
| `int64_t` / `uint64_t` | 217 / 205 | ❌ no 64-bit int | **Hardest structural problem.** Used for the constraint-graph coloring bitset, IDs, and timers. The 64-wide bitset must be reworked (e.g. arrays of 32-bit words, or two `int`s) and all bit ops adjusted. |
| `uint32_t`/`int32_t` | 164 / 197 | ⚠️ map to `int` | Mostly fine as signed 32-bit, but **unsigned semantics lost** — audit shifts, comparisons, hashing, wraparound. |
| `uint16_t`/`int16_t`/`uint8_t`/`int8_t` | 66/67/75/75 | ⚠️ widen to `int` | No packing — each becomes a full word. Memory grows; check any code assuming tight layout/serialization. |
| `float` | 1989 | ✅ native | Direct. |
| `double` | 58 | ⚠️ map to `float` | Precision loss; mostly in timing/diagnostics. Verify none are load-bearing for determinism. |
| `char` | 58 | ❌ no `char` type | Strings/names → `int[]`; or strip (mostly debug names). |
| `size_t` | 40 | ⚠️ map to `int` | Signedness only; usually fine. |
| SIMD (`immintrin`/`emmintrin`/`__m128`) | few | ❌ | Box2D ships a **scalar fallback** (`B2_SIMD_NONE`-style path). Force it — no SSE/NEON on Vircon32. |
| `atomic_*` | 8 | ❌ | Single-threaded console — replace atomics with plain ops. |
| `pthread`/`sched`/`semaphore` | 2 includes | ❌ | No threads. Replace the task system with a **serial** executor; keep the `b2TaskCallback` function-pointer interface (function pointers work!) but run tasks inline. |
| `...` / `va_list` / `stdarg.h` | 1 | ❌ | A variadic (likely assert/log). Remove or fix-arity. |
| `#if`/`#elif`, `##`, `#` | many in config | ❌ | Flatten config macros to `#ifdef`/`#ifndef`; remove token pasting. |
| by-value `b2Vec2`/`b2Rot`/`b2Transform` returns | pervasive | ❌ (>1 word) | See §4/§5: convert to pointer in/out or macro-inline. |

**Net read:** the port is feasible — function pointers, `malloc`/`free`, `const`, and
function-like macros (all newer than the guide admits) remove the biggest blockers — but
three things dominate the effort: (1) eliminating 64-bit integers from the constraint
graph/bitsets, (2) the by-value vector-math rewrite, and (3) reducing the threaded task
system to a serial one. SIMD and atomics are "select the existing fallback / stub" rather
than redesign.

## 15. Empirical verification & the proven porting idiom (VirconBox2D)

Everything above was first read from source; this section records what was then **confirmed
by actually compiling and running code** on `compile.exe` v26.04.24 + the emulator, during
the Box2D port. Work lives in `VirconBox2d/` (see `CLAUDE.md`).

### 15.1 Probe results — the hard blockers are real (and produce *errors*, not warnings)

Each was a minimal program fed to the real compiler (`VirconBox2d/probes/`):

| Construct | Verdict | Exact compiler message |
|---|---|---|
| Return a >1-word struct by value | ❌ error | `functions cannot return values of size > 1` |
| Pass a >1-word struct by value | ❌ error | `functions cannot pass arguments of size > 1` |
| Ternary `a ? b : c` | ❌ fatal | `'?' is not a valid identifier start` |
| Compound literal `(T){...}` | ❌ fatal | `invalid start of expression` |
| `#pragma once` | ❌ fatal | `unsupported preprocessor directive "pragma"` |

So §4/§5 (one-word function boundary) and §6 (no ternary) are not cautious guesses — they
are enforced. The one-word rule comes straight from the calling convention: each argument
is passed in a single register, the return comes back in `R0`.

### 15.2 The porting idiom that works (mirrors the official `vector2d.h`)

Confirmed to compile and run correctly (the ported `b2_math.h` passed ~75 known-value checks
in the emulator):

- A function that upstream **returned a struct** becomes `void` with a **result OUT-pointer
  as the LAST parameter**, and inputs passed as pointers:
  `b2Vec2 b2Add(b2Vec2 a, b2Vec2 b)` → `void b2Add(b2Vec2* a, b2Vec2* b, b2Vec2* result)`.
- **Scalar** returns (`float`/`int`/`bool`) stay by value — they're one word.
- Nested upstream expressions are **unrolled with named temporaries**.
- Ternaries → `if/else`; compound literals → temp + field assigns; `#pragma once` → guards.
- `math.h` provides `min/max/abs`, `fmin/fmax/fabs`, `floor/ceil/round`, `sin/cos/tan`,
  `asin/acos/atan2`, `sqrt/pow/exp/log`, `fmod` — use these (note: `sqrt` not `sqrtf`).
- Mid-function and nested-block (`{ ... }`) local declarations **are** accepted by v26.

### 15.3 Toolchain / runtime facts (confirmed)

- **Pipeline:** `compile.exe x.c -o obj/x.asm` → `assemble.exe obj/x.asm -o obj/x.vbin` →
  `packrom.exe x.xml -o bin/x.v32`. Fully scriptable.
- **Asset-free ROMs are valid:** `<textures />` and `<sounds />` may be empty.
- **Running:** `Vircon32.exe <rom.v32>` **auto-powers-on** and executes; `DebugLog.txt`
  records load + `CPU halted`, but **not** CPU hardware faults (those surface only in the GUI).
- **No autonomous readback:** the memory-card `.memc` file only flushes on a clean power-off
  that can't be triggered headlessly, and faults aren't logged — so correctness is verified
  **visually**: a harness paints the screen green (all checks pass) or red (any fail).
- `clear_screen(color)` + the `color_*` constants in `video.h` need **no texture**, making
  the green/red harness zero-asset.

### 15.5 ⚠️ Float-literal underflow — a silent, port-wide trap

The compiler's **lexer *and* its constant folder both underflow any float magnitude below
~1e-6 to exactly `0.0`** (emitting `0x00000000`). Measured threshold:

| Literal | Emitted hex | OK? |
|---|---|---|
| `0.000001` (1e-6) | `0x358637BD` | ✓ |
| `0.0000001` (1e-7) | `0x00000000` | ✗ → 0.0 |
| `0.00000011920929` (FLT_EPSILON) | `0x00000000` | ✗ → 0.0 |
| `1.0 / 8388608.0` (folded constant) | `0x00000000` | ✗ → 0.0 |

This is **silent** — no warning — and bit us: `FLT_EPSILON` became `0.0`, so a guard like
`if (absD < FLT_EPSILON)` was effectively `if (absD < 0.0)`, which is false for `absD == 0`,
so the code fell through and **divided by zero** (a runtime CPU fault, not a compile error).

**Workaround:** a tiny constant must be produced by a **runtime division whose divisor is a
global** (the compiler can't fold a global load, and hardware float division handles 1e-7
fine). The port does:
```c
float b2_two_pow_23 = 8388608.0;          // 2^23, a global
#define FLT_EPSILON ( 1.0 / b2_two_pow_23 )   // -> runtime 1.1920929e-7
```
Any Box2D tolerance below ~1e-6 (`FLT_EPSILON`, `1e-7`, etc.) needs this treatment. Values
≥ ~1e-3 (e.g. `0.0006`, `0.005`) lex fine. (Deferred optimization: compute such constants
once into a global at startup instead of dividing at each use.)

### 15.4 Status

`math_functions.h` is fully ported (`VirconBox2d/port/b2_math.h`) and **verified green**.
Deferred deviations: hardware (non-deterministic) `sin/cos/atan2` in `b2MakeRot`/`b2Atan2`;
`b2ComputeCosSin`/`b2ComputeRotationBetweenUnitVectors` from `math_functions.c` not yet ported.

## 16. Performance model — what code actually costs (ISA-verified 2026-07-06)

Grounded in the console spec (`ComputerSoftware/VirconDefinitions/Enumerations.hpp`
opcode list), the emulator CPU (`V32CPUProcessors.cpp`), the compiler emitter
sources, and instruction counts read off compiled `.asm` (probe
`probes/p13_asm_intrinsics.c`). Baseline: **~1 instruction = 1 cycle**,
15 MHz ⇒ **250,000 instructions per 60 fps frame**. `-O` flags are parsed and
**ignored** — there is no inlining, no CSE, no register allocation across
statements, no strength reduction. All optimization is manual or algorithmic.

### 16.1 What the hardware gives you in ONE cycle

| Opcodes | Note |
|---|---|
| `FADD FSUB FMUL FDIV FMOD FSGN` | float div is as cheap as mul — do NOT avoid divisions |
| `FMIN FMAX FABS` / `IMIN IMAX IABS` | min/max/abs are single instructions |
| `FLR CEIL ROUND CIF CFI` | rounding/conversion |
| `SIN ACOS ATAN2 LOG POW` | full transcendentals. **No SQRT opcode** — `sqrt` = `POW(x, 0.5)`; **no COS** — `cos` = `FADD π/2` + `SIN` (2 instr); `asin` = `ACOS`+2, `tan` = 2×`SIN`+`FDIV` |
| `IADD ISUB IMUL IDIV IMOD SHL NOT AND OR XOR` | integer ALU; `IMUL`/`IDIV` are 1 cycle — no shift tricks needed |
| `MOVS SETS CMPS` | **hardware memcpy/memset/memcmp, 1 cycle per word** (self-repeating instruction using CR/SR/DR) |

### 16.2 What the COMPILER makes you pay

- **Every function call ≈ 10 + 2·nargs instructions of pure overhead**
  (arg stores + `call` + prologue `push BP; mov BP,SP` [+ pushes] + epilogue +
  `ret` + result moves). Measured worst case: the port's
  `b2MaxFloat(x, 0.0) → fmax() → FMAX` chain = **28 instructions for 1
  instruction of work**. The stdlib "intrinsics" (§10) are *functions*, not
  intrinsics — in hot loops, either rewrite as inline `if`/arithmetic
  (3–5 instr) or use a §9.1 `asm` intrinsic (3 instr). This is the same
  economics that made the §5.6 manual inlining pass drop SOLVE by −31%.
- **Multi-word struct assignment `a = b` compiles to hardware `MOVS`**
  (`EmitAssignment`, `EmitBinaryOperationNodes.cpp:1516`): 3 setup instr +
  1 cycle/word. Likewise stdlib `memcpy`/`memset` are MOVS/SETS wrappers
  (+ call overhead). Consequences: swap-remove struct copies are already
  near-optimal; **whole-struct assignment beats field-by-field copying**
  beyond ~3 fields (each field costs 2–4 instr of address arithmetic + moves).
- The compiler emits redundant register moves around calls and reloads locals
  from the stack in every statement — one more reason call elimination
  dominates micro-tuning inside a statement.

### 16.3 Anti-optimizations — classic tricks that DO NOTHING here

- **There is no cache.** Every memory access costs the same 1 cycle. SoA
  layouts, hot/cold struct splitting, allocation pooling *for locality*, and
  cache-friendly iteration order buy **zero speed** (they can still reduce RAM
  footprint). Desktop/console intuition does not transfer.
- **Floats are full-speed hardware** (host FPU on the emulator, which is the
  reference platform). No fixed-point rewrites, no `1/x` precomputation *for
  speed*, no avoiding `FDIV`/`FMOD`.
- **No strength reduction needed**: `IMUL`/`IDIV` = 1 cycle; `x * 2` and
  `x << 1` cost the same.
- What DOES work on this machine, in order of payoff: **algorithmic** (sleep,
  fewer pairs, early-outs) → **call elimination in hot loops** (manual
  inlining, §9.1 intrinsics) → nothing else. Profile with the perf ROM before
  and after; treat 5–10% swings as noise.

### 16.4 ROM as free memory (`embedded` data)

Cartridge programs can embed binary files as arrays readable directly from ROM
address space — zero RAM, zero init cycles. Idiomatic uses for physics: baked
level geometry (pre-computed hulls/polygons instead of `b2MakePolygon` at
load) and a **host-side pre-built static broad-phase tree** (bake the node
array at ROM build time → instant load + SAH-quality balance without porting
`b2DynamicTree_Rebuild`). See PLAN_FOR_OPUS.md Part 0 §0.5 V5.

## 17. Findings from porting crisp-game-lib-portable (42 arcade games, non-Box2D)

Everything below came out of porting [crisp-game-lib](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib)
(via an SDL-targeted portable C rewrite, then a handheld-targeted port) to Vircon32 -
42 small arcade games sharing one engine, rather than a single large physics
library like Box2D. Different shape of codebase, so it surfaced a different
set of gotchas than §1-16 - smaller structs, heavier use of collision
detection and procedural audio, and, critically, actual compiled ROMs
verified round-trip through `unpackrom` and checked instruction-by-instruction
against `.asm` output, so the items below are grounded the same way §15
is for Box2D.

### 17.1 More rejected/accepted syntax than §14's cheatsheet covers

- **`typedef struct {...} Name;`** (anonymous struct + typedef) and
  **`typedef enum {...} Name;`** are both rejected outright - has to be a
  named `struct Name {...};` / `enum Name {...};`, which then works
  directly as a type per §2's `struct`/`typedef` section.
- **Designated initializers** (`{.field = value}`) and **compound
  literals** (`(Type){...}`) are both rejected - rewrite as positional
  initializers (in declared field order) or plain field-by-field
  assignment.
- **No pointer-minus-pointer arithmetic** - any `strchr()`-style code
  computing an offset via pointer subtraction fails; return an index
  directly instead.
- **Global variables can't be declared twice**, even without an
  initializer (unlike standard C's tentative-definition leniency) -
  `extern` (§2, confirmed supported) in headers, one real definition in
  the matching `.c` file.
- **Assigning a `const`-qualified value into a non-const target is
  rejected** ("discards const qualifier"), even for plain value copies
  (`thing->width = w;` where `w` is `const float`) - simplest fix is
  usually dropping `const` from the local/parameter rather than
  threading qualifiers through.
- **Comparing an array parameter against a global array with `==`
  fails** ("invalid operands for equality comparison") unless you take
  the address of its first element explicitly (`cards == &globalArr[0]`,
  not `cards == globalArr`).
- **Watch for identifier collisions with math.h macros** - `math.h`
  `#define`s `pi` as the mathematical constant, so `int pi = 0;` expands
  to `int 3.1415926 = 0;` and produces a confusing parser error nowhere
  near the real problem. Hit three times independently across unrelated
  games in this port. If an inexplicable parse error lands on an
  innocuous-looking line, grep for the variable name against every
  `#define` in the standard headers before assuming it's a compiler bug.
- **String-literal array initializers are checked strictly for buffer
  size** - a literal one character longer than its declared array is a
  hard compile error here, where more permissive toolchains (including
  whatever the original crisp-game-lib-portable source shipped against)
  silently truncated or overran. Caught two genuine pre-existing typos
  in upstream pixel-art data this way (a 7-character row in a
  declared-6-wide character grid) - worth treating as a real bug report
  from the compiler, not just an annoyance, if it turns up mid-port.

### 17.2 The `b2Vec2`-sized-return problem shows up anywhere a public API returns a struct

§5 covers this for Box2D's `b2Vec2`; it's not Box2D-specific. Any C API
being ported that returns a multi-word struct by value hits the same
wall, and the fix is the same out-pointer conversion:

```c
// before (doesn't compile - any struct over one word)
Collision c = rect(x, y, w, h);

// after
Collision c;
rect(x, y, w, h, &c);
```

Budget for this to touch *every call site*, not just the function
signatures, if the API is used pervasively - converting crisp-game-lib's
seven drawing functions (`rect`/`box`/`line`/`bar`/`arc`/`text`/`character`)
meant updating thousands of call sites across 42 games by hand.

### 17.3 Hardware traps confirmed by actually crashing the emulator

§16 covers the performance cost of `sqrt`/transcendentals; separately,
several arithmetic operations **hard-trap the CPU** rather than
producing `NaN`/`Infinity` the way most platforms do. These were found
by porting code that "worked" at compile time and then crashing the
real emulator, not by reading source - confirmed root cause each time by
reading the crash screen's reported instruction pointer against the
`.asm` output compiled with `-g` (debug symbols map IP back to a source
line and variable names, same technique as any native debugger - don't
skip building with `-g` while chasing one of these):

- **Division or modulo by zero** (integer or float) hard-traps. Any
  formula ported from a platform where this silently produces
  `Infinity`/`NaN` needs an explicit zero-guard before the divide.
- **`sqrt` of a negative number hard-traps** - consistent with §16.1's
  note that there's no SQRT opcode and `sqrt` is `POW(x, 0.5)` under the
  hood; a negative base to a fractional-exponent POW is exactly the
  input real hardware FPUs would flag too, this one just isn't silently
  swallowed. Guard any `sqrt(x)` where `x` could go negative due to
  float error accumulation (e.g. a value that's conceptually "always
  ≥ 0" but computed through several subtractions) even if it "should"
  never be negative on paper.
- **`atan2(0, 0)` hard-traps** rather than returning 0 - guard the
  degenerate case explicitly before calling it if both arguments could
  plausibly be zero simultaneously (e.g. a direction vector that's
  legitimately zero-length at some point in the logic).
- **A surprising fourth case: division by a *literal* zero constant is
  rejected at *compile time*, unconditionally** - not a runtime trap at
  all. `x / SOME_MACRO` where `SOME_MACRO` expands to the literal `0`
  fails to compile even inside a runtime `if` branch that could never
  execute when the macro is 0 (verified directly: a minimal repro with
  `if (MACRO > 0) { x = 5.0 / MACRO; }` where `MACRO` is `#define`d `0`
  fails to compile even though the division is provably unreachable at
  that value). This appears to be a purely textual/syntactic check on
  the divisor operand, not real reachability analysis, since routing
  the same divisor through a plain variable first (`int d = MACRO; x =
  5.0 / d;`) compiles fine and behaves identically at runtime. Relevant
  for any tunable `#define` constant that a library's own API might
  reasonably be configured to zero (e.g. "0 frames of fade" meaning "no
  fade") - a runtime guard alone does not make that configuration safe
  here; the divisor needs to be a variable, not the macro/literal
  directly, for a zero value to be usable at all.

### 17.4 A working technique for crash-diagnosing on this platform

Combining `unpackrom` (to inspect a built ROM's actual contents),
compiling with `-g` for debug symbols, and reading the emulator's crash
report (instruction pointer + register dump) against the resulting
`.asm` turned out to be a complete, repeatable diagnostic loop for
"compiles fine, crashes at runtime" bugs - the same shape of workflow as
debugging natively, just against Vircon32's own toolchain instead of
gdb. Worth setting up early on any port rather than guessing at runtime
behavior from source reading alone, given how much of §17.3 above (and
§16's cycle-cost figures) only builds real confidence once verified
against compiled output.

### 17.5 `print_at()` (`video.h`) as an engine-bypass for incidental text

Vircon32's BIOS ships a built-in font accessible via `print_at(x, y,
text)`, entirely separate from any texture/sprite system a ported
engine might build (crisp-game-lib's own font renderer, for instance).
Useful specifically when text needs to be drawn *without* going through
whatever higher-level draw/collision/caching pipeline the rest of a
port uses - a debug overlay being the obvious case, since routing debug
output through the same pipeline it's trying to measure taints the very
numbers it reports. Two things it does *not* do that a hand-rolled
draw call in a ported engine might otherwise handle implicitly, so
account for both explicitly if using it inside an existing renderer:

- It doesn't set a draw color itself - text comes out whatever
  `set_multiply_color()` was last set to. If the surrounding code
  caches GPU state to skip redundant register writes (worth doing in
  general - see §16.2 on call overhead extending to hardware `out`
  writes too), update that cache after calling `print_at()`, or a
  later draw call may wrongly assume the color register still matches
  its own last-known value.
- It draws in absolute physical screen pixels, using its own fixed
  built-in glyph size - not whatever logical/scaled coordinate system
  a ported engine's own view might use, and it does **not** get cleared
  by anything that only clears a ported engine's own logical draw
  area. If the physical region it occupies isn't otherwise touched
  every frame, old digits persist under new ones - draw an explicit
  backing rectangle (in the same physical coordinate space) before the
  text, every frame, if this matters.

### 17.6 Audio: `set_channel_speed()` covers most procedural-note needs alone

For any port that needs to play back arbitrary, non-tempered
frequencies (procedural sound effects, a chiptune-style engine, a
scale/melody generator) rather than fixed pre-mixed sound clips: a
single short single-cycle waveform sample (a few thousand words of
looped audio, plus `set_sound_loop()`/`set_sound_loop_start()`/
`set_sound_loop_end()` configured once to loop it continuously) covers
this without needing a full synth engine. `set_channel_speed()` is a
one-instruction hardware pitch control; playing a `wave_period`-sample
cycle at speed 1.0 sounds at `44100/wave_period` Hz, so hitting an
arbitrary target frequency is `speed = freq_hz * wave_period / 44100`.
The only thing worth layering on top by hand is a short linear volume
ramp (2-3 frames) at note start/stop via `set_channel_volume()`, purely
to avoid the audible click a same-frame jump to/from silence causes at
an arbitrary point in the waveform's cycle - not a real envelope, just
enough to avoid a discontinuity. This is meaningfully cheaper than a
full ADSR/LFO/arpeggiator synth *and* simpler to port correctly, if the
port doesn't actually need those features - verified directly: disassembling
both approaches for an identical note sequence showed the full-synth
version costing roughly 1.85x the instructions per frame, dominated by
an unconditional per-frame scheduler tick and per-voice feature-flag
checks that still run even when every flag is off.

### 17.7 Spatial partitioning is a legitimate O(n²)→O(n)-ish lever here, with one hardware-specific catch

§16.3 notes that cache-locality tricks are meaningless on this hardware
(no cache, flat memory cost) - but *algorithmic* wins (fewer total
comparisons) absolutely still apply, and a simple uniform grid over
whatever spatial structure a port's collision/proximity checks use is
a good return on effort if the naive approach is a linear scan against
everything registered so far (common in small 2D engines that use draw
order itself as part of their collision semantics, which rules out
simply batching or parallelizing the checks - the grid only needs to
speed up *how* each check searches, not change *when* it happens).
Concretely: partitioning into fixed-size cells, registering each
object into every cell its bounding box touches, and searching only
those cells cut total comparisons by roughly 60x for a moderately busy
scene in this port, verified against the original linear scan with a
native (off-console) test harness across random, boundary-aligned, and
forced-overflow scenarios before trusting it - zero mismatches. Two
things worth knowing if implementing the same pattern elsewhere:

- **Cell size and per-cell capacity are both worth empirically tuning,
  not guessing** - sweeping cell sizes against a workload's actual
  object-size distribution found a clear minimum in total comparisons
  (here, a cell size close to the *typical* object's own size, not the
  view's size or a round number), and per-cell capacity turned out to
  have **zero** effect on runtime cost in the non-overflow case (the
  search only iterates however many objects actually landed in a cell,
  never the cell's declared capacity) - so capacity should be sized
  against realistic *clustering* stress tests (many objects converging
  on one small area, not just raw object count spread across the
  view), and can safely be set generously once that's checked, since
  it costs only reserved memory, never speed.
- **Every fixed-capacity spatial structure needs a correctness
  fallback**, because no finite per-cell capacity can be guaranteed to
  never overflow under sufficiently pathological clustering (many
  objects genuinely occupying the same small area at once has no
  spatial separation left for *any* grid to exploit, regardless of
  capacity). The safe design is a fallback to the original,
  already-correct linear scan for the remainder of a frame the moment
  any cell would overflow, rather than silently dropping the
  overflowing entries from the index - a missed registration means a
  future query can miss a real collision entirely, which is a strictly
  worse bug than one frame getting no speedup.
