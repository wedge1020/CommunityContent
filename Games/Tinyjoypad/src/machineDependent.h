// The per-port interface every TinyJoypad compatibility shim (tinyJoypadShim.h,
// obonoCoreShim.h) is built on top of. Bodies live in portVircon32.c (Vircon32
// has no linker - see VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md section 11 - so these are plain
// forward declarations; the real definitions just need to appear somewhere
// later in the single compiled file, which they do via main.c's include

//
// Both upstream driver lineages (Lorandil/phoenixbozo's tinyJoypadUtils, and
// Obono's TinyJoypadWorks core) ultimately stream the real SSD1306 display
// one byte at a time, one hardware "page" at a time - each byte packs 8
// vertical pixels of a single column (bit 0 = top, bit 7 = bottom). There are
// only 256 possible byte values, so md_drawColumn() below takes that byte
// value directly and blits one of 256 pre-baked texture regions (see
// tools/gen_column_atlas.py) instead of writing any pixels - Vircon32's GPU
// is a texture-region blitter with no CPU-writable framebuffer.

// Sound(), this does not block: it returns immediately and the tone is
// stopped automatically by md_updateAudio() once its duration elapses,
// so gameplay/animation keeps running during a sound effect instead of
// freezing for it. Two or more genuinely concurrent calls (e.g. Tiny
// Pacman's continuously-retriggered power-pellet siren alongside its
// dot-eaten/ghost-eaten SFX) are now both actually audible instead of
// cutting each other off - a plain sequential burst of calls with no
// real time between them, though, is still only ever heard as a chord of
// near-identical short notes at best, not a melody: use a frame-stepped
// sequencer (see any game's own *AdvanceSfx()/*AdvanceNoteSeq() for the
// established pattern) for anything meant to be heard as several
