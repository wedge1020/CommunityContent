// =============================================================================
// SVELLAS mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, license "None specified" -
// GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_svellas`) - a puzzle game:
// walk a 6x4 grid of sliding 4x4-cell "panels" (each its own little room with
// walls/openings on each side), sliding panels into adjacent empty slots to
// reconnect passages and collect every star, while dodging up to 4 chasing
// monsters. 8 hand-authored stages, 3 lives, no persisted high score at all
// (upstream's own `HiScore` is entirely commented out throughout Main.cpp -
// a deliberate absence, not a gap this port should fill in, matching this
// project's own precedent of leaving a genuinely-absent upstream feature
// alone rather than inventing one, e.g. Tiny Bomber's own dead Music[]
// off-by-one left uncorrected).
//
// Ported directly from the sibling `UIAPduino_cracky` port already shipped
// in this project (`src/games/gameCracky.c`) - same author, same CH32V003
// RISC-V + SSD1306 hardware/driver lineage (`Oled.cpp`'s own
// `SendOledData()` streams one raw byte at a time, the exact same model
// `md_drawColumn()` already handles), the same real 60Hz SysTick timer
// (`Timer.cpp`'s `kTimerHz=60`), the same 4-direction+1-button input
// (`ScanKeys.h`), and - confirmed by direct comparison - byte-identical
// `AsciiPattern`/status-text machinery and identical GAME OVER/TIME UP
// overlay page+column+content. No new shim primitive was needed
// (isFire2Pressed() simply goes unused, same as Cracky).
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform, per Cracky's own hard-won
// conclusion** - `InitOled()` sends the exact same `OledCmd::RightToLeft`/
// `OledCmd::BottomToTop` register writes Cracky's own investigation already
// concluded need no software compensation (see gameCracky.c's own header
// for the full story of the wrong transforms tried and reverted there).
// `svlComposeRawByte(col,page)` is drawn directly at its own (col,page),
// no mirroring, no bit-reversal, no lookup table.
//
// **Rendering strategy deliberately diverges from Cracky's own "direct
// structural mirror" of upstream's incremental Back/Front VVram buffers** -
// upstream's `VVramBack` is a persistent map buffer incrementally patched
// by `DrawPanel()`/`ErasePanel()` calls only when a panel actually changes,
// copied to `VVramFront` and overlaid with sprites once per real frame.
// This port instead recomputes the *entire* 24x16 VVram grid from
// `svlPanelMap[24]` (the real source-of-truth panel-byte array) every
// single engine frame via `svlComputeMapVVram()` - the same "always
// redraw the full frame from source data, don't replicate a persistent-
// buffer incremental-patch trick" standing precedent this project has used
// repeatedly (Pinball/Doc/Bert/Tris/Pipe/Plaque/SQuest/Frogger, and
// Cracky's own `crkMapToVVram()`), applied here from the start rather than
// needing a later fix. This works cleanly specifically because
// `DrawPanel(pVVram, b, edge)`'s own glyph-selection logic is a *pure
// function* of (panel byte, edge-info) - re-derived here as
// `svlPanelGlyph(b, edge, relX, relY)`, called for all 16 cells of each of
// the 24 panels (24*16 = 384 = exactly VVramWidth(24) x VVramHeight(16),
// confirming the whole VVram grid really is just "the 24 panels laid out
// side by side", not a coincidence). One direct, useful consequence of
// this choice: upstream's own `VErase2()` call (patching `VVramBack`
// directly when a star is collected) becomes entirely redundant here -
// clearing the `Panel_Star` bit in `svlPanelMap[]` is sufficient, since
// the very next frame's from-scratch recompute naturally stops drawing
// the star glyphs on its own.
//
// The one thing that genuinely can't be derived from the static
// `svlPanelMap[]` alone is the panel *currently sliding* between two grid
// slots (removed from `svlPanelMap[]` for the duration of its move,
// tracked in `svlMovingPanel`/`svlPanelX`/`svlPanelY` instead, matching
// upstream's own equivalent fields) - composited as a small overlay pass
// right after the static grid, using `svlPanelGlyph(...,edge=0,...)`
// (upstream's own `MovePanel()` always calls `DrawPanel(pVVram,
// MovingPanel, 0)` while sliding - edge=0 forces "no arrows drawn on a
// panel that's actively mid-move", still reproduced exactly here).
//
// **A genuine, load-bearing timing derivation, worth spelling out in
// full - including a real bug in an earlier draft's own reasoning about
// it, found via live-play verification, not just inspection.** Upstream's
// `Main()` do-while loop calls `MovePanel()` unconditionally on *every*
// iteration, but `MoveMan()`/`MoveMonsters()`/`DrawAll()`/
// `WaitTimer(8/CoordRate)` only run once every 4th iteration (gated
// behind `(Clock&3)==0`). Since `MovePanel()`'s own internal step-gate
// (`(clock&CoordMask)==0`, with `CoordMask=CoordRate-1=0` since
// `CoordRate=1` here, exactly the same CoordShift=0 degenerate
// configuration Cracky's own Movable.h has) is *always true* regardless of
// its counter's value, every one of those 4 iterations performs a real
// panel-slide step - so between two consecutive *rendered* frames (i.e.
// two consecutive `WaitTimer(8)` calls), `MovePanel()` really does run
// exactly 4 times total. An earlier draft of this port concluded from
// this that a full panel-move (always exactly 4 grid-cell steps, since a
// panel only ever slides into an immediately-adjacent empty slot)
// "completes within a single gap between two rendered frames, and is
// never visibly seen mid-slide by the player" - and built
// `svlUpdatePlayingTick()` around that conclusion, running all 4
// `svlMovePanelStep()` calls back-to-back in the same tick a move starts,
// before ever rendering.
//
// **That conclusion was wrong**, caught via a live Puppeteer test that
// placed the man at a known slide-trigger cell (a temporary debug hook,
// removed again once confirmed) and sampled screenshots every ~70ms
// through an actual slide. Re-tracing the *exact* iteration order (not
// just the total call count) shows why: `MovePanel()` is called
// unconditionally EVERY iteration, including the one that just started a
// move via `MoveMan()` - so a freshly-started move's own FIRST step
// happens in the SAME iteration as the tick that started it, *before*
// that same iteration's own `DrawAll()`/`WaitTimer(8)` render. The
// render right after only ever shows that one step (1-of-4, a quarter of
// the way through the slide) - the remaining 3 steps run immediately
// afterward with no `WaitTimer()` gating them (so they happen back-to-
// back in real time, no frame displayed in between), and their combined
// effect - a *fully completed* slide - only becomes visible on the
// *next* rendered frame. A real player does see a brief, genuine 2-frame
// slide animation (1/4-done, then fully complete) - not the instant
// single-frame "snap" the original draft rendered. Confirmed directly:
// diffing 10 closely-spaced (~70ms apart) screenshots taken through a
// real slide showed two separate, non-adjacent frame-pairs with a real
// wall-structure change (each ~140ms apart, matching the real tick
// period), not one.
//
// **Fixed** by restructuring `svlUpdatePlayingTick()` (see that
// function's own header comment for the exact mechanics) to run any
// leftover "quiet" steps from a move the *previous* tick started FIRST,
// then this tick's own `MoveMan()`/`MoveMonsters()`/timer logic, then
// exactly one new panel step - mirroring upstream's real per-iteration
// interleaving instead of front-loading all 4 steps into the tick a move
// starts. The man's own alive-status check still runs after every single
// `MovePanel()` call in spirit (matching upstream's own
// `if((Man.status&Live)==0) goto lose;`, which runs after every
// `MovePanel()` call, not just once per group) - `Movable_Live` can only
// ever be cleared by `MoveMonsters()`, which itself only ever runs once
// per tick, strictly *before* any of that tick's own panel steps (leftover
// or new), so one check after the 3 leftover steps and one more after the
// new single step together are still equivalent to checking after every
// individual step.
//
// **A genuinely subtle, easy-to-miss C++ `static`-local semantic,
// preserved deliberately rather than accidentally reproduced or
// silently "fixed"**: upstream's `Main()` declares `static sbyte
// monsterNum = 0;` and `static byte timeDenom = MaxTimeDenom;` *inside*
// the function body, right after the `try_:` label - meaning these are
// genuine C++ function-local statics whose own initializer expression
// only ever runs the *first* time control reaches that declaration in
// the whole program's lifetime, never again on any subsequent `goto
// try_;` (life retry) or `goto stage;` (next stage). Real, intentional-
// or-not upstream behavior: both variables carry their mid-countdown
// value across every stage transition and life retry for the entire
// session, never resetting to their nominal "starting" value again after
// the very first time. Ported by declaring `svlMonsterNum`/
// `svlTimeDenom` as plain globals, explicitly initialized **once**, only
// in `gameSvellas_init()` - and deliberately *not* touched anywhere else
// in the state machine (not in `svlBeginTitle()`, not in
// `svlInitTrying()`, not in `svlUpdateStartJingle()`), reproducing the
// real "runs once, ever" semantic exactly. `MovePanel()`'s own separate
// `static byte clock;` needed no such treatment - since `CoordMask` is
// always 0, `(clock&CoordMask)==0` is always true regardless of `clock`'s
// value, making the counter itself entirely inert; dropped rather than
// ported, since there's nothing for it to gate.
//
// **A real AVR/C++-implicit-unsigned-byte-wraparound bug, caught by
// inspection and fixed before ever compiling - the same "AVR-implicit-
// narrow-type-reliance" bug family this project's own CLAUDE.md documents
// extensively (byte truncation / rand() range / shift wraparound /
// signed-sentinel comparison / logical-vs-arithmetic shift / int8
// overflow reliance), here via a sixth distinct mechanism**:
// `Monster::DecideDirection()`'s own pass-through ("ghost") fallback does
// `byte nextColumn = column + dx; byte nextRow = row + dy; can =
// nextColumn < ColumnCount && nextRow < RowCount;` - on real AVR hardware,
// `column=0` with `dx=-1` wraps `nextColumn` to 255 (a real `uint8_t`
// wraparound), which correctly fails the `< ColumnCount` bound and
// rejects the out-of-grid move. Vircon32's plain, non-truncating `int`
// would instead leave `nextColumn` at a genuine `-1`, which is `< 6`
// (`SVL_COLUMN_COUNT`) and would therefore *wrongly allow* a ghosting
// monster to wander off the left/top edge of the grid. **Fixed** with
// explicit `>= 0` checks alongside the existing upper-bound checks,
// reproducing the real bounds test the wraparound achieved implicitly on
// real hardware, without depending on any wraparound at all.
//
// **A real, root-cause title-screen text-layout bug, found and fixed after
// a user-supplied photo of the sibling Cracky game running on actual
// hardware proved this whole family's ported title screens had been using
// the wrong text-width model - see gameCracky.c's own header comment
// (search for `crkStatusChar`/`crkFullWidthText`/`crkBeginTitle`) for the
// full story.** Upstream's real `PrintC()`/`PrintS()` write to a Vram
// address space spanning the *entire* physical screen width - a genuine
// 32-char-cell-wide row (`VramStep=4` real pixels/cell, 128/4=32), not
// just the 8-cell status-label slice. The status labels (SCORE/STAGE/
// TIME/lives) really are confined to columns `LeftX`(24)-31 (confirmed
// directly in this game's own `Status.cpp`, `constexpr auto LeftX = 24;`
// - identical to Cracky's own `LeftX`) - but every piece of *title-
// screen* text (MINI, START, CONTINUE, the "INUFUTO 2026" credit) lives
// at real columns 8-23, using the exact same shared `PrintC()`/`PrintS()`
// mechanism at different column arguments, well clear of the status
// zone. This port's own `svlStatusChar` had been modeled as an 8-column-
// wide grid (matching only the status labels' own real range) and then
// ALSO used to hold the title screen's own text, reusing the same
// columns 24-31 the status labels need - the exact root cause of the
// symptoms an earlier draft "fixed" by truncating "CONTINUE" to "CONT"
// and shortening the credit line to "INUFUTO" alone, rather than by
// widening the grid to its real size. **Fixed** by widening
// `svlStatusChar` to `[8][32]` and adding a `svlFullWidthText` flag (true
// only during `SVL_STATE_TITLE`) so `svlComposeRawByte()` reads the full
// 32-column range instead of just columns 24-31 while the title screen is
// showing - see `svlBeginTitle()` below, now placing every piece of text
// at upstream's real, literal columns (re-derived directly from this
// game's own `Status.cpp`, not assumed identical to Cracky's): MINI at
// page 3 col 17 (`TitleLeft + 4*TitleLength - 5` = `2 + 20 - 5`, since
// this game's own `TitleLength=5` differs from Cracky's), the full
// "INUFUTO 2026" credit at page 7 col 12 (both fully spellable with this
// font after all - 'E' *is* in the shared `AsciiPattern` table, so
// "CONTINUE" needed no truncation either, contrary to the earlier draft's
// assumption), and "START"/"CONTINUE" at page 5/6 col 9 with the cursor
// at col 8 - upstream's own `ArrowX=8` - none of which collides with
// SCORE/STAGE/TIME's own columns 24-31 once the grid is genuinely wide
// enough to hold both regions side by side without overwriting either.
//
// **A second, related architectural issue, found and fixed the same way**:
// this port had also dropped upstream's own real title-screen logo bitmap
// (the hand-drawn "SVELLAS" wordmark, `Status.cpp`'s `Title()`'s own
// `TitleBytes[]` table) in favor of small plain text, reasoning - by
// direct analogy with Cracky's own earlier (and, at the time, also wrong)
// "purely decorative, drop it" call - that it was non-gameplay-relevant.
// It isn't: it's the single largest, most prominent element on the whole
// title screen, exactly like Cracky's own restored "CRACKY" logo (see that
// file's own header comment). **Fixed** the identical way: `svlTitleBytes`
// (80 values, byte-diff-verified against the real upstream source) is now
// drawn directly into `svlVVram` by `svlBeginTitle()` at upstream's own
// real position, and `svlComposeRawByte()` OR-combines that map-layer
// content with `svlStatusChar`'s own text layer instead of choosing one
// exclusively - safe because the logo (VVram rows 2-5, real hardware pages
// 1-2) and every piece of status/title text (pages 0/3/5/6/7) occupy
// entirely disjoint page ranges, confirmed the same way as Cracky's own
// fix. `svlCharPattern`'s own "logo" range (indices 0-15, the first 32
// bytes of that table) needed no fix at all - already byte-for-byte
// identical to upstream's real `CharPattern[]` logo range, confirmed via
// script before assuming otherwise.
//
// **The lives-remaining indicator** (upstream's real `Put2C(vram,
// Char_Remain)` - a little walking-man icon rendered via the *map-area*
// nibble-packed `CharPattern` glyph table, not the plain-text
// `AsciiPattern` this port's status-zone grid supports) is dropped in
// favor of plain text/blanks at upstream's real `LeftX`(24)-based
// columns, reusing Cracky's own already-established simplification for
// the identical situation (see `svlPrintStatus()` below) - not
// re-derived independently.
//
// **GAME OVER / TIME UP messages** reuse Cracky's own exact page/column/
// length/content (`svlBeginOverlay`, mirroring `crkBeginOverlay` -
// confirmed page4/col8/len9/"GAME OVER" and page4/col9/len7/"TIME UP" are
// byte-for-byte identical between the two upstream `Status.cpp` files, not
// a coincidence given the shared author/engine lineage) - the exact same
// "burn a message directly over the map area, outside the VVram grid"
// mechanism Cracky's own header comment documents in detail.
//
// **Sound**: same real multi-channel tracker as Cracky
// (`ToneChannel::Next()`/`SoundHandler()`), but a *different* tempo
// constant - `Tempo=170` here, not Cracky's `160` - giving a different
// real note-tick rate: `SoundHandler()`'s own `time -= Tempo; if(time<=0)
// time += 600/2;` amortizes to one note-tick every `300/170 =
// 1.7647058823529411` real 60Hz SysTick ticks (re-derived the same way
// Cracky's own `1.875` was, not assumed identical). `svlNoteFrames(length)
// = round(length * 300.0/170.0)`. Every melody table (`Sound_Loose/Hit/
// Beep/Move/Start/Clear/GameOver`, plus the two `StartBGM()` voices) was
// extracted via a small Python script that evaluates the real
// `NoteLength`/`Scale` enum arithmetic directly out of `Sound.cpp` (not
// hand-copied) and cross-checked against a raw token count of the
// original source with only line-comments stripped, confirming an exact
// 131/229-token match for the two BGM voices with no drift. `Sound_Move()`
// (a new one-shot "click" cue with no Cracky equivalent, fired via
// `StartMelody()`/fire-and-forget when a panel move begins) shares
// channel 0 with the item-pickup "Hit" cue exactly like Cracky's own
// shared-channel-0 design - confirmed the two can never collide in the
// same tick, since a panel-move can only start from an edge cell
// (`xMod`/`yMod` in {0,2}) while a star pickup can only fire from the
// panel's own center cell (`xMod==1 && yMod==1`), mutually exclusive by
// construction. `Sound_Beep()`'s own bonus-tally loop has a real detail
// Cracky's own bonus tally doesn't: upstream calls `Sound_Beep();
// WaitTimer(6);` - a real *additional* 6-tick wait on top of the beep's
// own blocking note duration, not just the note's own duration alone -
// reproduced as a single combined wait, `svlNoteFrames(1) + 6`.
//
// Movable coordinates are, just like Cracky's own Movable.h, already
// expressed directly in VVram-cell-grid units (`CoordShift=0`/
// `CoordRate=1` again make the generic sub-cell-precision parameterization
// fully degenerate) - kept as the real expressions throughout
// (`SVL_COORD_SHIFT`/`SVL_COORD_RATE`/`SVL_COORD_MASK`,
// `SVL_MAX_TIME_DENOM`'s own `50/(8/SVL_COORD_RATE)`) rather than
// silently pre-resolved to their current literal values, matching this
// project's - and Cracky's own - established preference.

// **A real animation-pacing bug, found via live-play verification (a

// at a known slide-trigger cell), not just by inspection.** An earlier
// draft of this function ran all 4 svlMovePanelStep() calls back-to-back
// within the SAME tick a move was freshly started (via svlMoveMan()'s own
// call into svlStartMovingPanel()), then rendered once - showing the
// panel already fully slid into its new position the very first frame the
// slide becomes visible at all. Upstream does NOT do this: tracing
// Main.cpp's own do-while loop precisely (Clock is a plain incrementing
// counter, `(Clock&3)==0` gates MoveMan()/MoveMonsters()/the real
// DrawAll()+WaitTimer() redraw to once every 4 loop iterations, but
// MovePanel() itself is called UNCONDITIONALLY on *every* iteration) shows
// that a freshly-started move's own FIRST step happens in the SAME
// iteration as the tick that started it (right after MoveMan(), before
// that iteration's own render) - so the very first rendered frame of a
// slide only ever shows it 1-of-4 steps in. The remaining 3 steps happen
// immediately afterward, but "quietly" (no WaitTimer() call gates them, so
// they run back-to-back in real time with no frame displayed in between) -
// their effect (a FULLY completed slide) only becomes visible on the
// *next* rendered frame, together with whatever else that next tick's own
// MoveMan()/MoveMonsters() does. So a real player sees a slide as a real,
// if brief, 2-frame animation (1/4-done, then fully complete) - never an
// instant single-frame "snap" the way this function used to render it.
// **Fixed** by restructuring to match that exact interleaving: each call
// first finishes off any move's own 3 leftover "quiet" steps left over
// from whatever the *previous* tick's own single step started, BEFORE
// this tick's own MoveMan()/MoveMonsters()/timer logic runs (exactly
// mirroring upstream's own Clock=4k+1/4k+2/4k+3 iterations, which always
// complete before Clock=4k+4's own logic block) - then this tick runs its
// own logic, then takes exactly ONE new panel step (matching upstream's
// own single per-iteration MovePanel() call bundled with that tick's
// logic), before finally rendering. The alive-check after the 3 leftover
// steps is still just one check for the whole group (not 3 individual
// ones) - safe for the exact same reason already documented for the
// single-step check below: Movable_Live can only change inside
// MoveMonsters(), which only ever runs once per tick, strictly BEFORE any
// of that tick's own panel steps - so it cannot change *during* a run of
// leftover steps either, making one check equivalent to checking after
// each step individually. On a fresh game/life/stage (svlMovingPanel==0
// already), the 3 leftover-step calls are harmless no-ops, matching
// upstream's own first few Clock iterations before any move has ever
