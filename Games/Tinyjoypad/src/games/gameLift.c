// LIFT mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, license "None specified" -
// GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_lift`, same "known author,
// unstated license" situation as this project's own sibling Cate-engine
// port, Cracky) - a climbing platformer: walk left/right across floors,
// ride vertical lifts up between them, and collect every item on a 12-
// column x 3-floor stage before the stage timer runs out, while dodging
// chasing monsters. 7 hand-authored stages (cycled repeatedly, with the
// per-stage time bonus shrinking every full lap through them), 3 lives,
// real in-session hi-score tracking (upstream has no EEPROM at all, same
// as Cracky - this is a CH32V003 RISC-V microcontroller, not AVR, so this
// project's own `eeprom_*` shim/avrCompat widening aren't relevant here).
//
// Ported directly on top of the already-proven `gameCracky.c` shim/
// rendering approach from the very same author's other Cate-engine game -
// see that file's own header comment for the full story of how its own
// hardware-orientation question was resolved. That resolution is reused
// here verbatim, with zero re-investigation: `InitOled()`'s two SegRemap/
// ComScanDec register writes exist purely to compensate for a physical
// panel-mounting quirk on some real SSD1306 breakout modules, with no
// equivalent to correct for in this software recreation - **no column
// mirror, no page reorder, no bit-reversal of any kind**. Every raw
// (col,page) byte is drawn directly at its own natural position via
// `md_drawColumn(col, page, value)`.
//
// **Structural differences from Cracky, despite the shared engine**:
// Movable/Actor here are two separate upstream structs (`Movable{x,y,
// sprite,clock}`, `Actor{Movable _; status; c; dx;}`), flattened into one
// combined `LftActor{x,y,sprite,clock,status,c,dx}` for Man/Monster (no
// vertical `dy` at all - Man/Monster never move themselves vertically,
// only via gravity or by riding a lift) rather than kept as a nested
// sub-struct - avoids ever needing a `->_.x`-style indirection chain, the
// same flattening precedent this whole project already uses for every
// other class-hierarchy port. `Lift{Movable _; x,bottom,top;}` is
// similarly flattened into `LftLift{x,y,sprite,clock,bottom,top}` -
// upstream's own separate `Lift.x` field and its embedded `_.x` are
// always numerically identical here (`_.x = x << CoordShift` with
// CoordShift permanently 0), so merging them into one field is a safe,
// deliberate simplification, not a behavior change. `CellMap` itself is
// genuinely NOT nibble-packed here (unlike Cracky's own 4-bit-per-cell
// `crkCellMap`) - it's one full byte (ported as one full `int`) per
// (column,floor) cell, 36 cells total (12 columns x 3 floors), since the
// richer cell encoding (floor/lift-shaft/lift-bottom/item type bits plus
// a 3-bit index into whichever table applies) needs more than 4 bits.
//
// **The map+status rendering split works out identically to Cracky's own
// (0-95 map / 96-127 status), just with a different row split**: VVram
// here is only 24x14 (`VVramHeight = 16-2`), not Cracky's 24x16 - the top
// 2 VVram rows are a fixed roof/ceiling decoration (not part of the
// scrollable stage), and the 12-row stage itself (3 floors x 4 rows) sits
// below that. 14 VVram rows / 2 = only **7** physical hardware pages get
// real map content (pages 0-6) - the map's own real columns (0-95) are
// simply never touched on page 7 at all (`VVramToVram()` only loops
// `VVramHeight/2` times). Reproduced directly rather than needing a fix:
// `lftComposeRawByte()` returns a flat 0 (black) for any (col<96, page==7)
// request, matching the known, constant, always-blank appearance this
// area has on real hardware (the same "reproduce a known-constant real-
// VRAM-persistence result directly" precedent already used for Wren
// Rollercoaster's own blank sky). Page 7's own real columns 96-127 are
// still live status text (the lives/remain-count display), exactly like
// every other page.
//
// **A genuine byte-truncation-reliance bug, caught proactively by
// inspection before ever compiling, not by a test run** - the first
// instance of this project's own well-documented "AVR-implicit-narrow-
// type-reliance" bug family found in this port: upstream's own
// `FillCellMap()` decodes a packed floor-layout bitstream with
// `mask <<= 1; if (mask == 0) { advance to next byte; mask = 1; }` -
// relying on a real `uint8_t mask` silently wrapping `0x80 << 1` down to
// `0` to detect "just consumed the 8th bit of this byte, advance to the
// next one." Vircon32's plain, non-truncating `int` would instead compute
// `256`, so `mask == 0` would never fire again after the very first byte,
// permanently desyncing the whole floor-layout bitstream from that point
// on (every column after the first 8 would silently read stale/wrong
// bits) - not a cosmetic glitch, a genuinely broken level layout on
// literally every stage. **Fixed** the same way as this whole project's
// very first documented bug (`md_drawColumn()`'s own byte-truncation
// fix): mask the shifted value explicitly, `mask = (mask << 1) & 0xFF;`,
// reproducing AVR's real 8-bit wraparound behavior on purpose rather than
// relying on an implicit narrowing this dialect doesn't have.
//
// **A second, much smaller latent-overrun risk, also fixed proactively**:
// `HitItems()`'s own combo-match bonus (`StartPoint(x,y,Rate); ++Rate;`)
// increments `Rate` completely unbounded on every consecutive same-type
// match, but `StartPoint()` only ever indexes a real 4-entry point-value
// table (and a matching 4-frame point-sprite range) - `Rate` reaching 4
// harmlessly overruns into adjacent PROGMEM on real AVR flash, but is a
// genuine out-of-bounds table read on Vircon32. Matching this project's
// own "preserve behavior, guard the crash" precedent (e.g. Tiny Arena's
// `Lvl1` off-by-one fix): `Rate` itself is still allowed to grow
// unbounded exactly like upstream (nothing else in the game reads it), it
// is only ever *clamped* right at the two places that actually index a
// table with it, inside `lftStartPoint()` itself.
//
// **Multi-rate real-time tick, decoded into one clean whole-tick
// divisor**: upstream's own main loop is NOT a single fixed-rate loop
// like Cracky's - it's `Clock`-parity-gated into three nested real-time
// rates (`Clock&1`: Fall+redraw, roughly every real `WaitTimer(4)` =
// 66.67ms; `Clock&3`: Man/Monster/timer logic, every other one of those;
// `Clock&7`: lift movement, every 4th one), with every ODD `Clock` value
// doing a full loop iteration that touches literally nothing (none of
// `&1`/`&3`/`&7` can ever match an odd number) other than incrementing
// `Clock` and re-checking the loop condition - a pure no-op that costs
// real time on AVR only insofar as the loop body itself takes time to
// skip past (negligible next to the real `WaitTimer(4)` blocking call on
// the following even iteration). Rather than simulate those no-op odd
// iterations at all, this port skips them entirely: `lftClock` only ever
// takes on the *even* values `Clock` would have held (0,2,4,6,8,...),
// advancing by 2 every real "tick" instead of 1 every real loop
// iteration - which reproduces the exact same `Clock&1`/`&3`/`&7` results
// upstream's own bitwise tests would have produced, with the exact same
// literal mask constants, just without wasting a whole port state on a
// value that can never do anything. One real logic tick = the real
// wall-clock duration of upstream's own `WaitTimer(4)` call (4 real 60Hz
// SysTick periods, confirmed via `Timer.cpp`'s own `kTimerHz=60`) = 4
// real Vircon32 engine frames at the same 60fps - `LFT_TICK_DIVISOR = 4`,
// gating the whole `gameLift_update()` playing-state body together
// (matching the majority "gate everything, not just movement" precedent
// already established by NumberPlace/HollowSeeker/t2048/Doc/Pacman/Pipe/
// Cracky in this project, rather than the movement-only/redraw-stays-60fps
// split used elsewhere) - `WaitTimer(4)` itself is simply dropped, its
// real-time pacing already fully provided by the divisor.
//
// **Sound**: same real 3-tone-channel software tracker shape as Cracky's
// own `Sound.cpp` (`Tempo=180` here, vs Cracky's `160`) - every call goes
// straight to `md_playTone()`/`md_stopTone()` exactly like Cracky, using
// the identical `crkMelodyLength()`/`crkMelodyValue()`-style id-based
// resolver and the identical 3-slot frame-stepped sequencer shape
// (0=one-shot SFX, 1=jingle/BGM-voice-A, 2=BGM-voice-B). Every melody
// table was byte-diff-extracted via a small Python script that evaluates
// the real upstream `NoteLength`/`Scale` enum expressions numerically
// (not hand-transcribed), confirming every table's own element count
// against the real upstream array before ever pasting it in. Each note's
// real duration is derived from `SoundHandler()`'s own real tempo formula
// (a channel advances once every `(600/2)/Tempo` real 60Hz ticks) exactly
// like Cracky's own `crkNoteFrames()`, just with Lift's own `Tempo=180`
// giving `300/180 = 5/3` ticks per note-length-unit instead of Cracky's
// `300/160 = 1.875`.
//
// **Item-matching combo mechanic, genuinely new versus Cracky**: collect
// an item of a DIFFERENT type than the last one collected for a flat +5;
// collect one of the SAME type as the immediately-previous one for an
// escalating bonus popup (`StartPoint`, values 10/20/40/80) instead,
// which also resets the "last type" tracker so a third consecutive same-
// type match needs a fresh two-in-a-row streak to trigger again -
// ported as a direct, faithful translation of `HitItems()`'s own real
// type-comparison state machine.
//
// **The title screen's own real "LIFT" bitmap logo (a hand-drawn 4-letter
// glyph table, `Status.cpp`'s own `TitleBytes[]`) was initially simplified
// to plain status-area text**, matching what was at the time Cracky's own
// established precedent for simplifying a purely decorative, non-gameplay
// title graphic - **this judgment call was later reversed, in both files,
// once a real user-supplied hardware photo of Cracky proved it wrong; see
// "A real bitmap logo restored, matching Cracky's own identical fix"
// further below for the final, current state.** A proactive fix applied
// from the start rather than rediscovered: reset `lftStageTime = 0`
// before `lftPrintStatus()` on the title screen, since nothing else
// clears it, and Cracky's own header comment already documents this
// exact "a stale TIME value lingers on the title screen after a game
// over" bug and fix for the identical situation.
//
// **A whole-file architectural fix, ported directly from Cracky's own
// identical, already-solved case, applied after a real user-supplied
// hardware photo of Cracky overturned this entire family's original
// title-screen text model** (see `gameCracky.c`'s own header comment,
// "A real user-supplied hardware photo overturns Cracky's own title-
// screen design", for the full story - summarized here since it applies
// verbatim to this file too). Upstream's real `PrintC()`/`PrintS()` write
// to a genuine 32-char-cell-wide row (`VramStep=4` real pixels/cell, 128
// real pixels / 4 = 32 cells), not the narrow 8-cell status-only slice
// this port originally modeled `lftStatusChar` as - the status labels
// (SCORE/STAGE/TIME/REMAIN) really are confined to upstream's own real
// `LeftX=24` columns (24-31, 8 cells), but the title screen's own text
// (the logo, "MINI", "START"/"CONTINUE", the credit line) lives at
// upstream's real columns 8-23, using the exact same shared
// `PrintC()`/`PrintS()` mechanism at different column arguments - not a
// separate, narrower grid at all, and - critically - NOT confined to only
// the pages nothing else uses either: since a page is 32 real columns
// wide, a status label at cols 24-31 and title text at cols 8-23 (or
// less) can share the SAME page with zero collision, something the
// original 8-column model had no way to represent. This is exactly why
// upstream's own real `Title()` freely places START/TIME on the same
// page (5) and CONTINUE/(nothing) on another (6) - it was never trying
// to dodge the status labels by hunting for an entirely free page, only
// by staying within its own real, wider column budget. Fixed the exact
// same way as Cracky: `lftStatusChar` widened from `int[8][8]` to
// `int[8][32]`, every status-label print call updated to upstream's real
// `LeftX`-based columns, and a new `lftFullWidthText` flag (true only
// during `LFT_STATE_TITLE`) lets `lftComposeRawByte()` read the full
// 32-column range instead of just the narrow status slice while the
// title screen is showing. `lftBeginTitle()` was rewritten to place
// "LIFT"/"MINI"/"START"/the now-un-truncated "CONTINUE"/"INUFUTO 2026"
// all at (a mix of) upstream's own real literal columns and, for the two
// purely decorative bitmap-logo replacements ("LIFT" itself, matching
// Cracky's own "CRACKY" precedent), a free page chosen the same way
// Cracky chose its own - nothing here needs trimming, relocating, or
// dropping anymore. See `lftStatusChar`'s own declaration comment and
// `lftBeginTitle()`'s own comment below for the exact column layout, and
// the dedicated verification-pass bug entry further below for how the
// missing 'L' glyph (needed to spell "LIFT" through the shared reduced
// font) was resolved - the same "append a hand-built glyph at the end of
// the font table" technique already proven for the sibling Hopman port's
// own missing 'H'.
//
// **A real bitmap logo restored, matching Cracky's own identical fix,
// found and applied in a later pass than everything above** - a second,
// related architectural issue to the whole-file fix just described:
// Cracky's own title screen was found (via a real user-supplied hardware
// photo) to have wrongly substituted its actual pixel-art wordmark logo
// for small plain text, on the mistaken assumption it was "purely
// decorative" - it's the single largest, most prominent element on the
// whole title screen, not a throwaway detail. This applies verbatim to
// this file too: `lftBeginTitle()`'s own "LIFT" text (drawn via the
// shared reduced font plus the hand-built 'L' glyph described above) has
// been replaced with upstream's own real `TitleBytes[]` bitmap logo (a
// new `lftTitleBytes[64]` table, byte-diff-verified against the real
// upstream `Status.cpp` source via a small Python script - 64 values,
// matching exactly), drawn directly into `lftVVram` at upstream's own
// real position (row 2, column `TitleLeft = (VVramWidth -
// 4*TitleLength)/2 = 4`) rather than as plain status-grid text. This also
// required rewriting `lftComposeRawByte()` from a plain if/else into an
// OR-combining compose (mirroring `crkComposeRawByte()` exactly) - the
// previous if/else meant `lftFullWidthText` disabled VVram/map rendering
// ENTIRELY while active, so the logo could never have reached the screen
// regardless of what was drawn into `lftVVram`; now the map byte and the
// status-text byte are computed independently and OR-combined, safe
// because the logo (pages 1-2) and every status-text element visible on
// the title screen (pages 0/3/5/6/7) occupy genuinely disjoint page
// ranges. `Chars.cpp`'s own "logo" glyph range (`CharPattern[]`'s first
// 32 bytes, indices 0-15) was independently re-checked against this
// port's own `lftCharPattern[0..31]` and confirmed already byte-identical
// - no fix needed there, only the title-drawing/compose logic. The
// hand-built 'L' glyph itself is left in `lftAsciiPattern`/
// `lftAsciiIndex()` unchanged (now unused by the title word specifically,
// but harmless, and nothing else in this file needs it removed) - see
// `lftTitleBytes`'s own declaration comment and `lftBeginTitle()`'s own
// comment for the full detail. Verified via a compile-only check
// (`compile src/main.c`, a clean "global variables" success line with no
// errors) per this pass's own explicit no-play-testing instruction - not
// independently re-verified live in the emulator this session.
//
// =============================================================================
// Verification pass (this session): this port had only ever been test-
// compiled, never played - a full line-by-line rendering-fidelity and
// game-state-progression audit against the real upstream source, plus
// live Puppeteer play, found and fixed five real bugs.
//
// **1) A genuinely broken title-screen word, found only by actually
// launching and looking, not by reading code**: `lftBeginTitle()` used to
// print "LIFT" as plain status-grid text via `lftPrintS(1,0,sLift,4)`.
// The shared 27-glyph `lftAsciiPattern` font (" 0123456789>ACEFGIMNOPRSTUV",
// the same real table upstream's own `PrintC()` uses - confirmed byte-
// identical to upstream via a script-driven diff) has **no 'L' glyph at
// all** - `lftAsciiIndex('L')` falls through its whole search and returns
// 0 (space), so the word silently rendered as " IFT" (a blank cell where
// 'L' should be), visible immediately on the real title screen. This
// wasn't a possible upstream oversight to preserve faithfully either:
// upstream never actually tries to spell "LIFT" through this limited
// font at all - its own real title uses a separate, hand-drawn bitmap
// logo (`TitleBytes[]`, rendered via `Put2C`/`CharPattern`, not
// `PrintC`/`AsciiPattern`) specifically because the mini-font can't
// represent every letter. A second, independent bug compounded it: page 1
// (where "LIFT" was drawn, columns 0-3) is not actually free - it's the
// exact page `lftPrintScore()` writes the live score's own digits into
// (columns 2-7, called moments earlier via `lftPrintStatus()`) - so even
// with a working glyph, "LIFT" would still have clobbered 2 of the 5
// score digits every time the title screen was shown, since the status
// grid was (at the time this was first found) still modeled as only 8
// columns wide - any two labels sharing a page collided regardless of
// which columns they'd have used on real, wider hardware. **Fixed at the
// time** by simply dropping the word (the menu already shows "LIFT" as
// the game's name before it's ever launched) rather than force-fitting it
// onto an already-claimed page - matching Cracky's own contemporaneous
// workaround for the identical situation.
//
// **This was later fully superseded, not just patched further**, once
// the real user-supplied hardware photo of Cracky (see this file's own
// top-of-file comment, "A whole-file architectural fix") proved the whole
// premise - "title text and status labels must fight over the same
// cramped 8-column page" - was wrong: a real page is 32 columns wide, so
// "LIFT" (cols 0-23) and the score digits (cols 24-31) were never
// actually going to collide on real hardware at all. With `lftStatusChar`
// widened to `[8][32]` and `lftFullWidthText` added, "LIFT" is restored
// as real text (page 2, col 0 - the same free page Cracky's own "CRACKY"
// title word uses, chosen for consistency rather than upstream's own
// literal bitmap-logo position, matching this port's established
// decorative-title-graphic-simplification precedent). Restoring it hit
// the exact missing-'L'-glyph problem described above again, this time
// fixed properly (not worked around) with a hand-built glyph appended to
// `lftAsciiPattern`/`lftAsciiIndex()`'s search table - the same technique
// already proven for the sibling Hopman port's own missing 'H' (see that
// file's own header comment for the precedent this follows). Verified via
// a fresh isolated Puppeteer test build: the title screen now shows
// "LIFT" (page 2), "SCORE"/live score digits (page 0/1), "MINI" (page 3),
// "STAGE N" (page 3), "START"/"TIME ..." sharing page 5, "CONTINUE" (now
// the full 8-letter word, page 6), and "INUFUTO 2026" (page 7) - all
// fully visible, non-overlapping, and un-truncated.
//
// **2) `lftPrintScore()`'s own column offset was doubled**, writing the
// 5-digit score at status-grid columns 4-8 and a trailing static '0' at
// column 9, instead of upstream's real columns 2-6 and 7
// (`PrintNumber5(Vram + VramRowSize*1 + (LeftX+2)*VramStep, Score)` -
// `LeftX` is the status region's own real origin, already fully
// accounted for by `lftComposeRawByte()`'s own column math, so it should
// never be added a second time as a local offset). Since
// `lftStatusChar` was only 8 columns wide (valid 0-7) at the time, columns
// 8 and 9 were genuine out-of-bounds writes - `[1][8]`/`[1][9]` spilled
// into the very next page's own row 0/1 (`lftStatusChar[2][0]`/`[2][1]`),
// so the score's own last digit and its trailing '0' visibly bled onto
// the row below TIME/STAGE as stray characters. **Fixed at the time** by
// using the correct local columns (2 and 7) - and, once `lftStatusChar`
// was later widened to `[8][32]` (see item 1's own follow-up above),
// re-expressed as upstream's real, literal columns (26 and 31) directly,
// the same "local col = real col - LeftX" -> "just use the real col"
// change every status-print call in this file went through. Verified via
// Puppeteer both times: the score renders cleanly with no stray digits
// appearing on adjacent rows, before and after the later widening.
//
// **3) `lftUpdateLoseAnim()` cut its own death-flash animation one frame
// short.** Upstream's real `LooseMan()` is a blocking
// `do { ShowSprite(...); Sound_Loose(); DrawAll(); ++i; } while (i<8);` -
// all 8 flashes, including the 8th/last one, get their own full wait for
// `Sound_Loose()` to finish before the function (and the whole animation)
// ends. The ported state machine instead checked `lftAnimStep >= 8` and
// transitioned straight to the retry/game-over path in the SAME call that
// had just shown the 8th flash and started its own wait timer - so that
// final wait was set but never consumed, and the last frame of the
// animation was never genuinely held on screen (overwritten by a fresh
// level's own first render on the retry path, or masked by the "GAME
// OVER" overlay in that same frame on the game-over path). **Fixed** by
// gating the post-animation transition behind `lftAnimStep < 8` too, so
// the 8th flash's own wait is genuinely consumed (one more pass through
// the wait branch) before the transition runs - matching upstream's real
// "show + wait, 8 times total, then transition" shape exactly. Verified
// via an extended live Puppeteer play session (deliberately walking into
// a monster repeatedly): RemainCount correctly stepped 3->2->1->0 across
// several real deaths (confirmed with a temporary on-screen debug digit,
// removed after), each retry correctly restored a fresh TIME/SCORE/board
// state, and the final death correctly reached the GAME OVER jingle and
// returned to the title screen - no stuck or frozen state at any point.
//
// **4) A real audio-ordering deviation**: upstream's own level-clear
// sequence is `WaitTimer(30); StopBGM(); Sound_Clear();` - the background
// music keeps playing through the real 500ms pause right after the last
// item is collected, only cut off the instant the CLEAR jingle itself
// begins. The port's `lftBeginClearWait()` instead called `lftStopBgm()`
// immediately on entering that state, silencing the BGM for the whole
// 500ms gap before the jingle even started. **Fixed** by moving
// `lftStopBgm()` into `lftUpdateClearWait()`, firing only once the wait
// genuinely elapses - matching upstream's real ordering. Audio-only, not
// independently verified by ear this session (matching this project's own
// standing caveat for audio-correctness fixes elsewhere), but the control-
// flow change itself was confirmed safe (build clean, no state-machine
// regression) via the same extended play session above.
//
// **5) A real, if narrow, crash risk in `lftCellMapPtr()`**, found by
// inspection while auditing every `>>` in the file for the logical-vs-
// arithmetic-shift hazard already documented extensively elsewhere in
// this project (HollowSeeker/Tiny Pipe/Nohzdyve/TinY Fi/Gilbert in the
// Downland, etc). Most callers guard `y >= LFT_STAGE_TOP` before calling
// this, matching upstream's own equivalent guards - but
// `lftDecideDirection()`'s two unconditional reads (matching upstream's
// identically-unguarded `DecideDirection()` in `Monster.cpp`) and
// `lftHitItems()` don't. A Man/Monster riding a lift right at its
// topmost point (`pLift->y == pLift->top`, a real, reachable position -
// e.g. stage 0's own first lift has `top=3`) lands at
// `y = pLift->y - LFT_COORD_RATE*2`, one row ABOVE `LFT_STAGE_TOP`. On
// real AVR, `(y - StageTop)` is a `uint8_t` subtraction that harmlessly
// wraps to a bounded garbage value; on Vircon32, the same subtraction is
// a genuine negative `int`, and `>>` is a documented *logical* shift -
// turning a small negative offset into an astronomically large positive
// one and reading `lftCellMap` wildly out of bounds (a real "ERROR:
// INVALID MEMORY READ" risk). **Fixed** by never shifting a negative row
// value (branch on sign first, matching this project's own established
// pattern) plus a defensive final clamp into the array's own real bounds
// as a centralized safety net for every caller, guarded or not. Not
// specifically reproduced live this session (a precise, multi-tick-timed
// edge case), but the fix is a pure guard with no effect on the common,
// already-extensively-verified case (lift-riding, monster chasing, and
// item pickup all rendered and behaved correctly throughout the play
// session above, with no regression from this change).
//
// Also checked carefully and confirmed correct (not just skipped): every
// data table (`lftAsciiPattern`/`lftCharPattern`/`lftFrequencies`/all 8
// melody tables/all 7 stages' floor-bits/man-position/monster/item/lift
// tables) byte-diffed programmatically against the real upstream source -
// all matched exactly, no transcription errors found. Every
// `lftComposeRawByte()` sub-column derivation (the `sub==0..3` cases)
// re-derived from `VVramToVram()`'s/`SendUL()`'s own real bit math and
// confirmed to match exactly - no hardware-orientation transform is
// present or needed, consistent with Cracky's own already-settled
// finding. Every `Actor.cpp`/`Movable.cpp`/`Monster.cpp`/`Man.cpp`/
// `Lift.cpp`/`Item.cpp`/`Point.cpp`/`Stage.cpp` function traced line by
// line against its ported counterpart - all matched exactly except the
// five bugs above. Every state transition's own reset steps (score/
// lives/stage/timers/sprites/cell-map/items) confirmed to happen in the
// same place upstream's own shared `NEWGAME:`/`title:`/`stage:`/`try_:`/
// `lose:` label structure does, including the item-persists-across-a-
// retry-but-not-across-a-new-stage distinction (`InitItems()` only ever
// called from `InitStage()`, `DrawItems()` from `InitTrying()` on every
// retry) - confirmed the port's own `lftInitStage()`/`lftInitTrying()`
// split preserves this exactly. No non-zero upstream global/member
// initializers were found needing an explicit port-side reset (grepped
// every real declaration in the upstream source; none exist beyond
// ordinary local-scope variables, all already correctly re-initialized
// per call).

// **A 28th (0-indexed 27) 'L' glyph appended at the END** (matching the

// upstream font genuinely has no 'L' at all (upstream never spells "LIFT"

// Hopman's own 'H': a full left vertical stroke (column 0 = 0x1f, all 5
// rows) plus a bottom-row horizontal stroke extending two columns to the
// right (columns 1-2 = 0x10, bit4/row4 only - the same "row bit set in
// every column the stroke spans" convention this font's own 'E'/'F'/'T'
// glyphs already establish for their own horizontal strokes), appended at

// **Rewritten after the same real user-supplied hardware photo of Cracky
// (see this file's own top-of-file comment) proved the previous version
// of this function was simply wrong** - it believed upstream's own
// title-screen text collided with the SCORE/STAGE/TIME/REMAIN status
// labels and had to be trimmed/dropped to fit: "LIFT" was cut entirely
// (compounded by the missing 'L' glyph bug, see lftAsciiPattern's own
// header) and "CONTINUE" was truncated to "CONTINU". Re-reading
// upstream's real `Status.cpp` (`Title()`) line by line shows this
// diagnosis was backwards: none of that text ever collides with anything
// upstream, because upstream's own Vram address space is a genuinely wide
// 32-char-cell-per-page canvas (see lftStatusChar's own header comment) -
// the status labels occupy only columns 24-31 (upstream's own
// `LeftX=24`), and every piece of title-screen text sits at columns 8-23
// or less, well clear of them. The ROOT problem was this port's own
// `lftStatusChar` being modeled as an 8-column-wide grid in the first
// place - now fixed there, this function is rewritten to place
// "START"/"CONTINUE"/the credit line at upstream's real, literal columns
// (with `lftFullWidthText=true` so lftComposeRawByte() renders the full
// canvas instead of just the narrow status zone), and "LIFT"/"MINI" -
// upstream's own real hand-drawn VVram bitmap logo and its subtitle - as
// plain status-grid text at a chosen free page, matching Cracky's own
// established "simplify a purely decorative title graphic to plain text"
// precedent rather than reproducing the literal 16x4 pixel-block bitmap.
