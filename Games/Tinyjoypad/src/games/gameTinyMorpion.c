// Tiny Morpion - ported from Daniel C's Tiny-Morpion.ino (tinyjoypad.com,
// GPLv3). Same tinyJoypadShim lineage as every other Daniel-C game here
// (FastTinyDriver.h) - Sound()/isXPressed() reuse the existing shim as-is.
//
// A tic-tac-toe (French: "morpion") game against a CPU opponent with 3
// difficulty levels. Move the cursor with the d-pad, place a mark with
// Fire; first to a line wins the round (best of up to 9 rounds - reaching
// 9 wins ends the whole match and returns to the difficulty menu).
//
// Button mapping (matches every other Daniel-C game's own established A0/
// A3 thresholds, confirmed directly against this game's own
// `spritebank_TMORPION.h`, which - unusually for this project - is where
// this particular game's own author put the button-threshold #defines,
// not `ELECTROLIB.h`):
//   analogRead(A0) in (500,750) = isRightPressed()
//   analogRead(A0) in [750,950) = isLeftPressed()
//   analogRead(A3) in (500,750) = isUpPressed()
//   analogRead(A3) in [750,950) = isDownPressed()
//   digitalRead(1) (active low) = isFirePressed() - place a mark, confirm
//     the difficulty menu.
//
// Structural changes from upstream:
//  - `BOARD[3][3]` (accessed both 2D, `BOARD[y][x]`, and flat via
//    `uint8_t *p = &BOARD[0][0]; p[0..8]`) flattened to a single
//    `int[9] tmorpionBoard`, with every `BOARD[y][x]` site rewritten as
//    `tmorpionBoard[y*3+x]` - avoids needing to test whether this dialect
//    supports taking the address of a 2D array element and using it as a
//    flat pointer, and the code already treated it as flat 90% of the
//    time anyway.
//  - upstream's `loop()` is a `NEW_GAME:` goto-chain around a difficulty-
//    select menu (with its own nested busy-wait-for-release loops) and a
//    gameplay `while(1)` - rewritten as an explicit frame-stepped state
//    machine (`tmorpionState`), same approach as every other
//    tinyJoypadShim port here. The genuinely blocking pieces (see below)
//    each got their own dedicated state.
//  - `BLINK_WINNER_TMORPION()` (a real 10-iteration, two-redraw-per-
//    iteration blocking blink of every mark belonging to the winning
//    player - not just the 3 cells in the winning line, confirmed by
//    reading the function directly) became a `TMORPION_STATE_BLINK_WINNER`
//    sub-state advancing one half-iteration per real engine frame (20
//    half-steps total). `NULL_GAME_TMORPION()`'s own 30-iteration draw
//    "buzz" (real `_delay_ms(4)` between tones) became
//    `TMORPION_STATE_NULL_GAME_BUZZ`, one step per frame.
//  - **The largest computed sound sweep in this project's history**:
//    `SND_BOX_TMORPION(5)` (played when the CPU wins the whole match) is
//    `for(t=200;t>10;t--){Sound(200-t,3);Sound(t,12);}` - **190
//    iterations x 2 calls = 380 synchronous `Sound()` calls**, edging out
//    Tiny Pipe's own ~500-call death sweep only because that one still
//    holds the literal top spot, but in the same extreme ballpark and
//    the largest *dual-tone* sweep found - same root cause/fix as every
//    other one of these: converted to a downsampled (step -15 instead of
//    -1, ~13 dual-tone steps) frame-stepped sweep. `SND_BOX_TMORPION(4)`
//    (player wins the whole match) is a smaller but still real 38-call
//    alternating two-tone alarm (`for(t=1;t<20;t++){Sound(4,80);
//    Sound(100,80);}`) - each note has a genuine ~25-40ms felt duration,
//    so this one didn't need downsampling, just the standard frame-
//    stepped treatment. `SND_BOX_TMORPION`'s own cases 2/3 (which called
//    `COMPLETED_PROCEDURE_TMORPION()`/`NULL_GAME_TMORPION()` from *inside*
//    a sound-dispatch switch) are never actually invoked anywhere -
//    confirmed dead by grep before dropping.
//  - `switch`/`case` avoided proactively throughout (matching Tiny Doc/
//    Bike/Pipe's established caution) - including several genuine GCC
//    case-range extensions (`case 0 ... 3:`) - all rewritten as `if`/
//    `else if` chains. Every intra-function `goto` used as a structured-
//    control-flow shortcut (`goto GoOut`/`GoNext`/`PUTCORNER`/etc. in the
//    CPU AI helpers) was rewritten with plain `if`/`else`/early `return`
//    instead of tested verbatim, same reasoning as Tiny Pipe's own port.
//  - `rand()%3`/`rand()%4` (in the CPU's random-move fallback and its
//    "replicate a symmetric position" heuristic) switched to the shared
//    `arand(n)` helper - the same rand()-range-mismatch fix already
//    applied to every other game's own random helper in this project.
//  - `CPU_DOUBLE_TMORPION()` is declared but never called anywhere in the
//    file - confirmed dead by grep, dropped rather than ported verbatim.
//    `Trace_LINE`/`DIRECTION_LINE`/`Return_Full_Byte`/`RECONSTRUCT_BYTE`/
//    `Universal_Swap` (`ELECTROLIB.h`'s line-drawing primitive) and
//    `Mymap` (only ever used *by* that same dead primitive) are likewise
//    never called from the game logic - the same "provably dead, don't
//    port verbatim" finding as Tiny Pipe's identical `ELECTROLIB.h`.
//  - Every render function's partial page-row range (`Tiny_Flip_TMORPION`
//    took an explicit `START_`/`END_` row range, with the per-tick idle
//    redraw only covering rows 2-7 versus a full 0-7 redraw right after
//    a move is placed) was simplified to always redraw the full 8 pages,
//    matching this project's own established "don't rely on real SSD1306
//    VRAM persisting a skipped row" precedent - proactively here rather
//    than needing to first prove it was actually safe upstream (it likely
//    was, since the skipped rows only ever change right after a full
//    redraw already ran, but there was no reason to be the one port that
//    re-litigates that question instead of just always drawing everything).
//  - A subtle **cursor-rendering trick** worth documenting since it's easy
//    to misread: the in-game cursor has no dedicated sprite of its own -
//    frame index 2 of `UP_TMORPION`/`MIDDLE_TMORPION`/`DOWN_TMORPION`
//    (the same index used for "genuinely empty, no mark" elsewhere) is
//    reused as the cursor-position indicator graphic. For any *non*-
//    cursor cell, an empty cell (`value==2`) is skipped entirely (no
//    sprite drawn, matching every other game's own "return 0 means
//    background shows through" convention) - but for the cursor's own
//    cell specifically, that early skip is *not* applied: the sprite
//    lookup always runs, using either the real cell content (blink-off
//    phase) or a forced value of 2 (blink-on phase) - so hovering an
//    empty cell shows the cursor graphic steadily (both phases resolve
//    to frame 2), while hovering an already-marked cell makes it visibly
//    blink between the real mark and the cursor graphic. Ported exactly
//    as this two-branch structure (cursor cell: always draw; non-cursor
//    cell: skip only if genuinely empty), not simplified, since the two
//    branches are not equivalent.
//  - A minor, deliberate simplification, noted rather than silently
//    dropped: upstream's own `Check_WIN_TMORPION` loop does not `break`
//    after a non-terminal win (`COMPLETED_PROCEDURE_TMORPION()` returning
//    0, meaning the win counter incremented but the match continues) -
//    it keeps scanning the remaining winning lines, and a single move
//    that completes *two* lines at once (rare, but possible in real tic-
//    tac-toe) would upstream call the whole resolve procedure a second
//    time, double-incrementing the win counter for one move. Since this
//    port's resolve procedure is now a genuine multi-frame animated
//    state (not an instant function call upstream could re-enter same-
//    frame), replicating that exact double-trigger isn't practical -
//    this port resolves at most one winning line per move instead.
