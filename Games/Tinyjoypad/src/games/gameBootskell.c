// =============================================================================
// BOOTSKELL mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, license "None specified" -
// GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_bootskell`) - a push-block
// action puzzle: push blocks around a 12x7 map to crush wandering monsters
// with them (readme: "Push a block to hit a monster and defeat it. Watch out
// - monsters push blocks at you too."). No ladders/climbing here (unlike the
// sibling `gameCracky.c` port) - every actor moves in 4 directions on a flat
// grid, and the only way to lose is a monster-pushed block sliding into you.
// 8 hand-authored stages, 3 lives, session-only score (upstream's own
// `word HiScore;` is commented out in Main.cpp - genuinely never tracked at
// all, not just dropped by this port - matched faithfully rather than added
// as a new feature).
//
// Same "cate" engine lineage as gameCracky.c (same author, same shared
// Vram/VVram/Oled/Timer/Sound/Print architecture) - this port follows that
// file's own proven methodology throughout; see its own header comment for
// the fuller rationale behind several of the choices repeated here. Only 4
// directions + 1 action button (`ScanKeys.h`'s own `Keys_Button0`, confirmed
// via `ScanKeys.cpp` - no second button exists on this hardware), covered by
// `tinyJoypadShim.h` with isFire2Pressed() unused, same as Cracky.
//
// **No hardware-orientation transform, confirmed by the same reasoning
// already proven for Cracky**: `Oled.cpp`'s `InitOled()` sends the identical
// `OledCmd::RightToLeft`/`OledCmd::BottomToTop` pair Cracky's own header
// explains is a real-panel-mounting correction with nothing to compensate
// for in software - `bskComposeRawByte(col,page)` draws directly at its own
// (col,page), no mirror, no bit-reversal.
//
// **Rendering mirrors Bootskell's own real Back/Front VVram split exactly**,
// which is a genuine architectural difference from Cracky (Cracky recomputes
// one VVram grid from scratch every tick; Bootskell keeps TWO 24x16 grids,
// `bskVVramBack` - the persistent map/fence/settled-or-animating-block layer,
// only touched when something in it actually changes - and `bskVVramFront` -
// rebuilt every real DrawAll() from Back, then had every live sprite (Man/
// Monsters/moving Blocks/Points) composited on top). Ported as a direct
// structural mirror of upstream's own `VVramBackToFront()`+`DrawSprites()`+
// `VVramToVram()` split (the same "faithfully copy an intricate stateful
// algorithm's own shape" reasoning as Cracky's own VVram note and Frogger's
// row-buffer compositing elsewhere in this project) rather than collapsing
// it into one function - `bskDrawAll()` only does the first two steps
// (rebuild Front); the final "blit to the real screen" step is `bskRender()`,
// called exactly once at the end of every real engine frame by the state
// machine, matching Cracky's own crkDrawAll()/crkRender() split. Upstream's
// own dirty-tracking `Backup[]` (a real-hardware bandwidth optimization) is
// dropped, matching this project's now-standard "always redraw the full
// frame" precedent.
//
// **A dense text-overlay layout puzzle, solved with a small generalized
// overlay mechanism rather than Cracky's single-slot one.** Every piece of
// UI text in this game (SCORE/STAGE/TIME/lives, the title screen's "MINI"/
// credit/START/CONTINUE+cursor, GAME OVER, TIME UP) is written via upstream's
// `PrintC()`, which sends raw ASCII-font bytes directly to real Vram
// addresses, bypassing VVram entirely - on real hardware these persist
// because nothing else re-touches those exact bytes (the same real-VRAM-
// persistence class already found and fixed for Cracky's own GAME OVER/
// TIME UP messages). Tracing the *real* absolute pixel columns upstream uses
// (not guessed) found two genuinely different regions in play at once:
//   - SCORE/STAGE/TIME/lives always sit at `LeftX`(24 char-cells)+N, i.e. the
//     fixed 8-char-cell-wide strip at real columns 96-127 - reused Cracky's
//     own `crkStatusChar[8][8]` grid mechanism verbatim (bskStatusChar),
//     but with the *correct* relative column math (upstream's own
//     `LeftX+N` value minus `LeftX` itself, e.g. `PrintNumber5(...,
//     LeftX+2)` becomes column 2, not "2+2"=4) - re-deriving this by hand
//     instead of literally transcribing gameCracky.c's own equivalent
//     numbers surfaced that crkPrintScore's own `2+2`/`2+7` column choices
//     don't actually match this derivation (they'd need relative columns
//     2 and 7, not 4 and 9 - the latter overruns crkStatusChar's real
//     8-column width). Not something this port needed to fix (it's
//     Cracky's own already-shipped file, out of scope here), but worth
//     flagging: this port's own status-grid columns were derived fresh
//     from Bootskell's real Status.cpp/Print.cpp source instead, and every
//     one lands inside 0-7 by construction (SCORE label cols0-4; score
//     value cols0-4 + a literal trailing '0' at col5, matching upstream's
//     own "track score as a x10 value, always show one extra zero digit"
//     design; STAGE label cols0-4 + 2-digit number cols6-7; TIME label
//     cols0-3 + 3-digit value cols5-7; a single lives digit at col0, a
//     deliberate simplification of upstream's own `Char_Remain` icon
//     row - see below).
//   - The title screen's logo/"MINI"/credit/START/CONTINUE/cursor are all
//     positioned at real absolute columns *within the map area* (0-95), not
//     the status strip - generalized Cracky's single `crkOverlayActive`
//     into a small fixed array (`BSK_OVERLAY_COUNT`=4: MINI, credit,
//     START-line, CONTINUE-line), each an independent (active,page,col,
//     text,len) slot checked in `bskRender()`'s own per-pixel loop before
//     falling back to the normal VVram-tile lookup - reproducing upstream's
//     real title-screen positions exactly (MINI at page3/col19, credit at
//     page7/col12, START/CONTINUE+cursor at page5-6/col8) rather than
//     rebasing everything into the cramped 8-column status strip the way
//     Cracky's own title screen did. The cursor character is folded
//     directly into the START/CONTINUE line's own text array (col0 of
//     each, '>' or ' ') and rebuilt unconditionally every real frame this
//     port's own always-redraw model needs no "did the selection change"
//     dirty-tracking at all, unlike upstream's own real `changed` flag
//     (a bandwidth optimization with no equivalent need here). All 4
//     slots are reused later for GAME OVER/TIME UP (only slot 0 needed at
//     a time there, cleared via `bskClearOverlays()` on every real state
//     transition that leaves them behind - InitTrying and BeginTitle both
//     call it, matching every prior overlay-user in this project's own
//     "clear state that doesn't get naturally overwritten" lesson).
//   - Deliberately NOT calling the gameplay SCORE/STAGE/TIME/lives status
//     readout (`bskPrintStatus()`) on the title screen at all, unlike
//     upstream's own `Title()` (which does call it first, then partially
//     overwrites some of the very same cells with its own decorative text
//     - upstream's `PrintStatus()` writes "STAGE" at the identical
//     page/column its own `INUFUTO`-equivalent credit text uses moments
//     later on Cracky's title screen, and something similar likely happens
//     here too). Since Bootskell's title/status layouts don't actually
//     overlap columns in *this* port (status strip vs. map area are
//     disjoint), there'd be no real collision to avoid here either way -
//     the real reason to skip it is that a freshly-reset SCORE/STAGE/TIME
//     readout isn't meaningful before a game has even started, and this
//     keeps the title screen simple. A deliberate, documented
//     simplification, not a bug.
//   - The title logo IS ported pixel-perfect (not simplified to text like
//     Cracky's own "CRACKY"/"INUFU" did) - checked the available font
//     first and confirmed simplifying to plain text wasn't actually
//     viable here: the ASCII font (`" 0123456789>ACEFGIMNOPRSTUV"`) has no
//     B, K, or L, so "BOOTSKELL" itself cannot be spelled with it at all -
//     exactly why upstream needed a hand-drawn pixel logo in the first
//     place. Porting the raw 96-byte `TitleBytes` table (byte-diff
//     extracted via script) directly into `bskVVramFront` once, at
//     `bskBeginTitle()`, following upstream's own exact nested-loop
//     layout (6 side-by-side 4x4-tile blocks spanning VVram rows 2-5, the
//     full 24-column map width) was simpler and more faithful than
//     inventing a substitute.
//
// **A dense multi-rate real-tick structure, genuinely different from
// Cracky's own single-gated loop.** Upstream's `do{...}while(MonsterCount!=0
// || AnyBlockMoving());` loop has THREE independent bitmask gates on the
// same free-running `Clock` byte (`Clock&3`, `Clock&0x1f`, and the render/
// pace gate `Clock&7` wrapping a single `WaitTimer(3)`), plus an UNGATED
// `UpdateBlocks()` call running on every single loop iteration - a real,
// deliberate design where blocks visibly slide faster (updated 8x per
// render) than Man/Monster movement and timer countdown (updated only 2x
// per render, at Clock%4==0) and far faster than new-block spawning
// (Clock%32==0, once per 4 renders). Since only the ONE `WaitTimer(3)` call
// (at the render gate) consumes any real wall-clock time - every other
// iteration in between executes at full bare-loop speed on real hardware,
// with nothing rendered in between to make the exact sub-batch ordering
// observable - this port batches one full "8 Clock values" cycle into a
// single inner loop, run once every `BSK_TICK_DIVISOR`(3) real engine
// frames (matching `WaitTimer(3)`'s own real duration at this project's
// 60Hz native tick rate), calling `bskDrawAll()`/`bskRender()` exactly once
// at the end of the batch rather than trying to reproduce upstream's own
// mid-batch render timing (which has no visible effect regardless, since
// nothing else redraws in between on real hardware either). The
// `Clock&3`/`Clock&0x1f` gates, the ungated `UpdateBlocks()`, the death
// check after every sub-tick, and the `MonsterCount!=0||AnyBlockMoving()`
// loop-exit check after every sub-tick are all reproduced exactly, matching
// upstream's own early-exit semantics (a mid-batch TimeUp or death event
// skips the remaining sub-ticks in that batch, same as upstream's own
// `goto lose;`). See `bskUpdatePlaying()`'s own comments for the exact
// mapping. Same "decouple logic-tick cadence from render cadence" family
// of fix already needed by Tiny Arkanoid/Tiny SQuest/Ardumania elsewhere in
// this project, just with three distinct sub-rates batched together instead
// of one uniform multiplier.
//
// **Sound**: same real 3-tone-channel tracker as Cracky's own `Sound.cpp`
// (byte-for-byte identical `ToneChannel`/`EffectChannel` mixer code), but a
// different `Tempo`(180, not 160) - re-derived the note-duration formula
// from scratch rather than reusing Cracky's own precomputed 1.875 constant:
// `SoundHandler()`'s real cadence is `(600/2)/Tempo` real 60Hz ticks per
// note-length-unit, giving `1.6666667` here (`bskNoteFrames(length) =
// round(length * 1.6666667)`). Every melody routed through
// `md_playTone(freqHz, durationSeconds)` the same way as Cracky (this
// engine's own multi-voice fix means the one-shot SFX channel and the two
// simultaneous BGM voices never fight over a shared channel) - melodies
// resolved by id via `bskMelodyLength()`/`bskMelodyValue()` (Tiny Dungeon's
// own "resolve by id, not by real pointer" precedent), byte-diff-extracted
// from `Sound.cpp` via a small Python script (not hand-copied) rather than
// trusted from a first eyeballed transcription, matching this project's own
// "byte-diff transcribed tables" discipline. Sequencer slots: 0=one-shot
// SFX (Sound_Loose/Hit/Beep/Push all multiplex this one channel, matching
// upstream's own real channel-0 usage exactly), 1=jingle/BGM-voice-A,
// 2=BGM-voice-B - all three advance every real engine frame regardless of
// `BSK_TICK_DIVISOR`, matching upstream's own `SoundHandler()` running off
// the same real 60Hz SysTick interrupt as `Main()`'s own loop, never itself
// throttled by any of the `Clock&N` gates.
//
// **Movable coordinates are genuinely non-degenerate here** (unlike
// Cracky's own `CoordShift=0` special case) - `MapShift=1`/`MapRate=2`:
// grid-cell lookups (`GetCell`/`SetCell`) use `x>>MapShift`, while a
// Movable's own raw `x`/`y` (and every Sprite's own draw position) stay in
// "half-cell" VVram-column units directly (`VVramWidth`(24) ==
// `MapWidth`(12)*`MapRate`(2), so no extra scaling is ever needed between a
// Movable's raw coordinate and its VVram draw position - confirmed by
// tracing `Sprite.cpp`'s own `ShowSprite()`, which copies `pMovable->x`
// straight into the sprite's draw `x` with zero shift). A single "step" of
// `MoveCountMask`(7)+1=8 real sub-ticks moves a Movable by exactly 1 raw
// unit (half a visual cell) via `DirectionElements[]`'s own literal ±1
// deltas - two such steps cross one real map cell, giving the same smooth
// half-cell walk/slide animation upstream has.
//
// **A real, proactively-fixed byte-truncation-reliance bug, the same class
// documented throughout this whole project's own history** (this port's
// own first instance, caught by inspection before ever compiling, not by a
// crash report): `Stage.cpp`'s real `GetCell(byte x, byte y)` relies on `x`/
// `y` being *unsigned* - a negative raw coordinate (reachable any time a
// Movable checks the cell one step past a map edge, e.g. `NextCellOrMovable`
// at `Man.x==0` facing left) wraps to a large positive byte value on real
// hardware, which the existing `if (x >= MapWidth || y >= MapHeight) return
// Cell_Wall;` bound already catches correctly by coincidence. Vircon32's
// plain `int` doesn't wrap the same way, so `bskGetCell()` explicitly checks
// `x < 0 || y < 0` too, rather than trusting an unsigned-wraparound trick
// this dialect's own widened-`int` model can't reproduce. A related,
// deliberately-added safety guard: `PushBlock`'s own local `x`/`y`
// ("2 raw units ahead of the pusher", used only to *check* whether a push
// is even legal) can also go negative right at a map edge, and gets shifted
// (`x>>1`) before that check - added an explicit sign-safe halving helper
// (`bskSafeShiftR1`) rather than relying on Vircon32's own *logical*
// (zero-fill, not sign-extending) `>>` happening to still produce a huge-
// enough positive value to be caught by the same bound (verified by hand
// that it *would* still work by coincidence, but this project has
// consistently preferred an explicit guard over relying on that kind of
// accident - see HollowSeeker/Tiny Pipe/Nohzdyve/Gilbert in the Downland's
// own identical `>>`-of-a-possibly-negative-value fixes). Every OTHER
// `>>MapShift` site in the file (`NextCellOrMovable`, block/monster
// position-to-grid conversions) was checked and confirmed to only ever
// operate on an already-non-negative Movable/Block coordinate (each one is
// kept in-bounds by its own "check before advancing" gate before ever
// being shifted), so none of those needed the same treatment.
//
// **A second real, proactively-fixed bug: `OnHitBlock`'s own score-
// multiplier table can run one hit past its own bounds.** `pBlock->clock`
// (reused here as a 0-3 "how many monsters has this one push already hit"
// counter, incremented up to `MaxRate`(3)+1=4 after the 4th hit) indexes a
// literal 4-entry `Values[]` table (`{10,20,40,80}`) - a 5th consecutive
// hit from the same still-moving block would read `Values[4]`, one past the
// table's own real bound. Harmless on real hardware (an adjacent-flash-byte
// read); a genuine out-of-bounds array read here. Clamped `rate` to 3
// before indexing `bskPointValues[]` - the same "preserve behavior, guard
// the crash" treatment already used for Tiny Arena's own `Lvl1` off-by-one
// and several others in this project.
//
// **A genuine, faithfully-preserved upstream typo, not "fixed"**:
// `Monster.cpp`'s `DecideDirection()` compares `pMonster->targetX <
// pMonster->_.y` (X against Y) in its horizontal-tie-break branch - the
// exact same X-vs-Y mixup already found and deliberately preserved in
// Cracky's own `crkDecideDirection()` (see that file's own comment on this
// one) - both games share the same author and the same underlying AI
// shape, so this is very likely the identical, real, shipped quirk rather
// than two independent transcription slips. Kept exactly as upstream has
// it. A second, separate, genuine upstream oddity (not a transcription
// risk, traced through by hand): `DecideTarget()`'s own line-of-sight
// distance formula, `distance = Abs(manX,thisX) + Abs(manY,thisY)`, doesn't
// actually depend on the candidate target position it's comparing at all -
// it recomputes the exact same Man-to-monster Manhattan distance every one
// of the 4 direction checks, so `minDistance` can only ever be set by the
// FIRST qualifying direction (later directions' identical `distance` value
// can never beat an already-equal `minDistance`). Ported exactly as
// written - a faithful reproduction of upstream's own real targeting
// behavior, not a bug this port introduced.
//
// **Two dead upstream fields/functions confirmed via grep, not ported**:
// `Math.cpp`'s own `Rnd()`/`RndIndex`/`Numbers[]` (a real PRNG, but never
// actually *called* anywhere in this game - Bootskell has no randomness at
// all, unlike Cracky which does use its own identical table); `Monster.h`'s
// `pushCount` field and `Sprite.h`'s `StepMask` constant (both declared,
// neither ever referenced). `Stage.h`'s own `StageWidth`/`StageHeight`
// constants are likewise declared but never used anywhere in the real
// source. `Status.cpp`'s `PrintPerfect()` is defined but never called.
// None of these were ported.
//
// **The lives readout was simplified**, matching Cracky's own precedent for
// the identical `Char_Remain`-icon display upstream has (both games share
// this exact status-line shape) - shown as a single plain digit
// (`RemainCount`) rather than porting the icon-row logic, partly because
// the ASCII font can't spell "LIVES" either (no L).
//
// **A 30fps whole-tick throttle was NOT added** - upstream's own real
// `WaitTimer(3)` IS a genuine, deliberate real-time rate (not the "no
// timing model whatsoever" category several other beyond-scope ports in
// this project needed a throttle added to), and `BSK_TICK_DIVISOR`(3)
// already reproduces it directly - no further slowdown was requested or
// warranted. Confirmed the exact match, not just approximately: real
// hardware's `Timer.cpp` runs its own SysTick at a genuine, hardcoded
// 60Hz (`kTimerHz = 60`), the same rate this whole engine runs at, so
// `WaitTimer(3)` really does mean "wait 3 real 60Hz ticks" on both
// platforms identically - no unit-conversion guesswork needed. Also
// confirmed `SoundHandler()`'s own real `Tempo=180`/`(600/2)`-per-fire
// cadence against this same real 60Hz tick: a channel's `Next()` (one
// melody-note-length unit) fires on average every `300/180 =
// 1.6666667` real ticks, exactly matching `BSK_NOTE_UNIT_FRAMES` - both
// re-derived from the real register/constant math rather than assumed
// from Cracky's own already-shipped value.
//
// **A meticulous re-verification pass** (this game was ported in a large
// parallel batch and only ever test-compiled, never played - a real
// dialect bug, a 2D array passed by value into `bskVPut2S`/`bskVPut2C`,
// was already caught and fixed by removing the unused-in-practice grid
// parameter during central registration, making this file a known
// higher-risk candidate for a live audit) re-read every real upstream
// `.cpp`/`.h` file line by line against this port, byte-diff-verified
// every data table via a small Python script (`AsciiPattern`/
// `CharPattern`/`TitleBytes`/`Frequencies` from `Chars.cpp`/`Status.cpp`/
// `Sound.cpp`, all 8 stages' `start`/`enemyCount`/`pEnemies`/`bytes[]`
// from `Stages.cpp`, and all 9 melody note tables from `Sound.cpp`,
// resolving each side's own symbolic note names to the same numeric
// values before comparing) - every single one matched exactly, and also
// confirmed via a direct grep that every real upstream `VPut2S`/`VPut2C`
// call site (`Block.cpp` x2, `Stage.cpp` x2) always targets `VVramBack`
// and never `VVramFront`, so the parameter-removal fix above is safe by
// construction, not just by absence of a counter-example found so far.
// Two genuine bugs were found and fixed:
//
// 1) **A real, significant gameplay-balance bug: monsters moved ~1.67x
//    too fast.** `Main()`'s own do-while loop gates `MoveMonsters()`
//    behind more than just `(Clock&3)==0` - it also has a second,
//    independent `sbyte monsterNum` frame-skip accumulator
//    (`if(monsterNum>=0){MoveMonsters();monsterNum-=10;}monsterNum+=6;`)
//    that throttles monster movement to only 3 calls out of every 5
//    times the outer gate fires (a real, deliberate difficulty choice -
//    monsters visibly move slower than the player and blocks). This
//    port's first version omitted the accumulator entirely, calling
//    `bskMoveMonsters()` unconditionally every time `(bskClock&3)==0`
//    fired - the same rate as the player, i.e. monsters moved 5/3 times
//    faster than upstream intends. **Fixed** with a new `bskMonsterNum`
//    global reproducing the exact same accumulator (reset to 0 alongside
//    `bskClock` in `bskUpdateStartJingle()`, matching upstream's own
//    `try_:` label resetting `Clock`/`monsterNum` together before the
//    start jingle plays) - verified the exact call/skip sequence via a
//    standalone Python simulation (18 calls out of 30 gate-fires = 3/5,
//    matching by construction). The `goto lose`-skips-the-whole-block
//    semantics (a mid-iteration TimeUp discards the pending monsterNum
//    update for that tick too, not just the `MoveMonsters()` call) are
//    preserved by nesting the whole accumulator inside the existing
//    `if(!timeUp)` guard.
// 2) **A real rendering-fidelity bug: the live score number rendered 2
//    columns too far left.** `Status.cpp`'s real `PrintScore()` places
//    the 5-digit value at `(LeftX+2)*VramStep` (relative column 2, not
//    0) with the trailing extra '0' digit immediately after it at
//    relative column 7 (not 5) - re-derived directly from `Print.h`'s
//    `VramStep`/`Vram.h`'s `VramRowSize` math rather than assumed. This
//    port's first version used columns 0 and 5 instead - harmless (page1
//    is otherwise unused, so nothing overlapped), but a genuine, visible
//    divergence from upstream's real on-screen position. **Fixed** by
//    changing `bskPrintScore()` to `bskPrintNumber5(1,2,...)` and
//    `bskPrintC(1,7,'0')`. Every other status-text column (SCORE/STAGE/
//    TIME labels and values, the lives digit, the title-screen MINI/
//    credit/START/CONTINUE overlays, GAME OVER/TIME UP) was independently
//    re-derived the same way and confirmed already correct.
//
// **Verified live** via this project's own Puppeteer/WebGL harness (a
// freshly rebuilt ROM, own isolated server instance): the alphabetized
// menu correctly lists "BOOTSKELL" (credited "BY INUFUTO"); the title
// screen renders the pixel-perfect logo, "MINI", the cursor-driven START/
// CONTINUE selection, and the "INUFUTO 2026" credit with no corruption;
// starting a game shows the correct initial STAGE 1/TIME 90 (60 + 30 for
// stage 0's 1 enemy, matching `InitTrying()`'s own formula exactly) with
// the score value now visibly offset 2 columns right of the "SCORE"
// label (confirming fix #2); movement in all 4 directions and repeated
// block-pushing (score climbing correctly, e.g. 0->40->50 across a play
// session) all rendered correctly with no garbled tiles; and, reached
// live rather than forced via a debug hook, a genuine player death
// (RemainCount visibly dropping 3->2 on the status line) correctly
// triggered the full `LOSE_ANIM`->respawn sequence - the same stage
// re-initialized with a fresh TIME value near 90 and a newly-reset block
// layout, exactly matching `goto try_`'s own "retry the same stage, keep
// score, decrement lives" semantics. A genuine level-clear/game-over
// were not independently forced this session (stage 0's own single
// monster wasn't cornered into a scripted kill within a reasonable
// number of blind automated button presses) - both reuse the exact same
// `OnHitBlock`/`bskUpdateBonusTally`/`bskUpdateGameOverJingle` control
// flow already verified correct by direct line-by-line comparison
// against `Block.cpp`/`Main.cpp` above, so risk is low, but worth a
// direct check if anything looks off in a future session.
