// CACORM mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, license "None specified" -
// GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_cacorm`, same author/engine
// lineage as this project's own already-shipped gameCracky.c) - a Qix-style
// area-capture game: walk around the border of a 12x7-cell maze (LEFT/RIGHT/
// UP/DOWN), draw a line out into open space and back to any already-drawn
// line to close off a region; any stars ("items") enclosed inside the newly-
// closed region are captured for points. Clear every item to advance to the
// next of 8 hand-authored stages. Touching a chasing monster costs a life
// (3 lives per game); an occasional "Increaser" bonus pickup grants a spare
// life. No hi-score is tracked at all - confirmed directly from upstream's
// own `Main.cpp` (`word Score; // word HiScore;` - HiScore is commented out,
// genuinely unused anywhere in the source), unlike gameCracky.c's own game,
// so this port has no equivalent to `crkHiScore`.
//
// Same real 60Hz SysTick-based frame limiter as gameCracky.c
// (`Timer.cpp`'s own `kTimerHz=60`), and the exact same `Clock&3`/`Clock&1`/
// `WaitTimer(4)` main-loop timing shape - working out the real elapsed time
// between logic ticks (2 of every 4 `Clock` increments call `WaitTimer(4)`,
// i.e. 8 real 60Hz ticks = ~133ms per logic tick) lands on the same
// `CAC_TICK_DIVISOR=8` gameCracky.c already uses for its own, differently-
// timed main loop - not assumed identical, independently derived and only
// coincidentally the same value (both games share the same "cate" engine
// author/template, so a shared real-time constant isn't a total surprise).
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform is applied, matching
// gameCracky.c's own hard-won conclusion exactly** - `cacComposeRawByte()`
// is drawn directly at its own `(col,page)`, no mirroring, no per-bit
// reversal. See gameCracky.c's own header comment for the full story of why
// an SSD1306 `SegRemap`/`ComScanDec` pair does NOT imply a software
// transform is needed here.
//
// **Rendering reuses gameCracky.c's own two-level VVram tile system
// verbatim** - `VVram` is a 24x16 logical glyph-index grid (`cacVVram`,
// same dimensions as gameCracky.c's own `crkVVram`); `cacComposeRawByte()`
// packs each pair of vertically-stacked VVram cells into 4 real output
// bytes via the identical 2-byte-per-glyph `CharPattern` lookup and nibble-
// interleaving gameCracky.c's own `crkComposeRawByte()` already established
// and proved correct - not re-derived from scratch, since both games'
// upstream `VVramToVram()`/`SendUL()` functions are byte-for-byte the same
// shared "cate" engine code. Upstream's own `Backup[]` dirty-tracking
// buffer (a real-hardware I2C-bandwidth optimization) is dropped, matching
// gameCracky.c's own precedent of always redrawing the full frame instead.
//
// **A second VRAM-persistence case handled the identical way as
// gameCracky.c's own overlay mechanism**: `PrintGameOver()`/`PrintTimeUp()`
// write their message text directly into real Vram bytes *inside the map
// area* (page4, column 8 or 9 respectively - confirmed via direct reading
// of `Status.cpp` to be the *exact same* page/column values gameCracky.c's
// own `crkPrintGameOver()`/`crkPrintTimeUp()` already use, since both games
// share the same font/screen-layout convention), bypassing the VVram grid
// entirely. Reproduced with the same `cacOverlayActive`/`cacOverlayText`/
// `cacOverlayPage`/`cacOverlayCol` overlay scheme gameCracky.c already
// built and proved - during rendering, any raw (col,page) landing inside
// the overlay's own footprint draws from `cacAsciiPattern` instead of the
// VVram-derived byte.
//
// **Status text (SCORE/STAGE/TIME/lives) is written via raw direct Vram
// addressing upstream, at real char-cell columns 24-31 (`LeftX=24`) - the
// exact same real-hardware address space gameCracky.c's own title screen
// bug (see that file's own header comment on `crkStatusChar`) was found
// against.** `PrintC()`/`PrintS()` upstream write to a genuinely WHOLE-
// SCREEN-WIDE Vram address space (32 real 4-pixel-wide char cells per
// page row, `VramRowSize`/`VramStep`), not a narrow sidebar-only grid -
// the status labels just happen to live at the high end of it (columns
// 24-31), while the title screen's own text (see below) lives at the LOW
// end (columns 2-23), well inside what during real gameplay is the
// VVram-composited map area. **This file originally modeled
// `cacStatusChar` as only `int[8][8]` (just the status-label slice) and
// then tried to cram ALL of the title screen's own text into that same
// narrow 8-column grid** (see the "genuine, visible title-screen
// rendering bug" entry further below, and gameCracky.c's own identical
// mistake and fix) - **widened to `int[8][32]`, matching gameCracky.c's
// own fix exactly**, with every print call below now using upstream's
// real, literal columns directly (no more "local 0-7 offset from the
// status zone" indirection) - `cacComposeRawByte()` reads it back across
// the FULL real column range whenever `cacFullWidthText` is set (title
// screen), or just the narrow 24-31 status-label slice otherwise (normal
// gameplay), the identical architecture gameCracky.c's own
// `crkFullWidthText`/`crkComposeRawByte()` already established and
// proved correct.
//
// **Title screen now draws upstream's own real pixel-art "Cacorm" logo
// bitmap, matching gameCracky.c's own identical fix** (see the dated
// section at the very end of this header comment for the full story -
// this paragraph previously said the logo was "simplified to plain text,
// matching gameCracky.c's own established simplification", which was true
// at the time but is now stale: gameCracky.c's own logo was itself later
// restored to its real bitmap after a direct user report, and this game
// was fixed the identical way in the same follow-up pass). Upstream's
// real `Title()` draws the logo (a 5-cell-wide dithered-gradient bitmap
// built from the shared "logo" glyph set, glyphs 0-15) directly into the
// map/VVram area (real columns 2-21, pages 1-2), then separately writes
// real raw-Vram text for "MINI" (col 17, page 3), "INUFUTO 2026" (col 12,
// page 7), "START"/">" (col 9/8, page 5), and "CONTINUE"/">" (col 9/8,
// page 6) - all of it via the exact same whole-screen-wide `PrintC()`/
// `PrintS()` mechanism `PrintStatus()` itself uses, just at different,
// non-overlapping columns. This port now draws the real logo bitmap
// (`cacTitleBytes[]`, byte-diff-verified against upstream) directly into
// `cacVVram` at its own real position, exactly matching upstream's pixel
// output, and restores every other piece of title text - MINI, the full
// "INUFUTO 2026" credit (not the previously-cropped "INUFUTO"), START,
// and the full "CONTINUE" (not the previously-cropped "CONTINU") - to
// upstream's own real, literal columns, since none of them collide with
// the status labels' own columns 24-31 (or with each other) once the grid
// is genuinely full-width. `cacComposeRawByte()` OR-combines the VVram-
// derived logo byte with the status/title-text byte (the two occupy
// disjoint page ranges by construction, so this can never blend two real
// pieces of content together). See `cacBeginTitle()`'s own header comment
// for the exact column values.
//
// **A genuine AVR-unsigned-byte-wraparound reliance, fixed rather than
// ported literally** - upstream's `GetCell(byte x, byte y)` bounds-checks
// only `x>=MapWidth||y>=MapHeight`, relying on `byte` (uint8_t) wraparound
// to turn a would-be-negative `x-1` (reached whenever `CanMove()` probes
// one cell left of the map's own left edge) into a large positive value
// that the `>=MapWidth` check then correctly rejects as "off the map,
// treat as a wall". Vircon32's plain, non-wrapping `int` doesn't do this -
// the exact same "AVR-implicit-narrow-type-reliance" bug class already
// documented at length in this project's own CLAUDE.md (byte truncation,
// signed-sentinel comparison, shift wraparound, `int8_t` overflow
// reliance) - so `cacGetCell()` adds an explicit `x<0||y<0` guard,
// reproducing the *intended* "off the map counts as a wall" behavior by
// construction instead of by an AVR-specific side effect.
//
// **Every genuinely blocking upstream `WaitMelody()` call converted to
// this project's own established frame-stepped state machine**, matching
// gameCracky.c's own state shape closely: CAC_STATE_TITLE (`Title()`'s own
// internal key-poll loop, though upstream's own `while(ScanKeys()!=0);`
// busy-wait-for-release on a direction change is replaced with a plain
// edge-detected toggle, matching gameCracky.c's own precedent),
// CAC_STATE_START_JINGLE (the blocking `Sound_Start()` held before play
// begins), CAC_STATE_PLAYING (the main tick-gated loop), CAC_STATE_LOSE_ANIM
// (`LooseMan()`'s own 8-step spin-and-beep loop), CAC_STATE_GAMEOVER_JINGLE,
// CAC_STATE_CLEAR_WAIT (the real `WaitTimer(10)` pause),
// CAC_STATE_CLEAR_JINGLE, CAC_STATE_BONUS_TALLY (the real
// `while(StageTime>=BonusRate){...Sound_Beep();}` bonus-countdown loop).
// One upstream blocking sound call, `Sound_Hit()` (fired once per item
// inside `EraseItems()`'s own loop - which can process *multiple* items
// in a single call, each blocking for its own melody duration on real
// hardware, giving a sequential multi-beep combo sound), is instead fired
// non-blocking/fire-and-forget per item - matching this project's own
// established "collapse a real-hardware sequential-blocking sound burst
// into a single async trigger" precedent (Vircon32's `md_playTone()` is
// already genuinely multi-voice, so this isn't the queueless-single-
// channel collapse-to-last-tone bug class, just a deliberate simplification
// of a purely cosmetic multi-beep pacing effect).
//
// **Sound**: upstream's own `Sound.cpp` is the same real 3-tone-channel
// software mixer/tracker as gameCracky.c's own game (`Tempo=180` here, not
// gameCracky.c's `160`) - every call routed through `md_playTone()` the
// same way, via a small `cacMelodyLength()`/`cacMelodyValue()` id-based
// resolver and three independent frame-stepped sequencer slots
// (0=one-shot SFX, 1=jingle/BGM-voice-A - reused for both, exactly like
// upstream's own channel 1 and gameCracky.c's own identical channel reuse,
// 2=BGM-voice-B). Every melody table was extracted from upstream's real
// `Sound.cpp` via a small Python script (resolving the `NoteLength`/
// `Scale` enum symbols and the one computed `N8+N2` length expression to
// plain numbers), not hand-transcribed - each note's own real duration is
// derived from `SoundHandler()`'s own tempo formula
// (`cacNoteFrames(length) = round(length * (300/180))`), matching
// gameCracky.c's own `crkNoteFrames()` derivation shape exactly, just with
// CACORM's own real Tempo value.
//
// Movable coordinates (`Movable.x/y`) are, like gameCracky.c's own
// finding, already expressed directly in VVram-cell-grid units (no extra
// scaling needed to composite a sprite/tile), confirmed by tracing
// `LocateMovable()`'s own formula. Unlike gameCracky.c, this game
// introduces a second coordinate resolution above the base "coord" unit -
// `MapShift`/`MapRate`/`MapMask` (Movable.h) - since the man/monsters only
// ever draw a line segment or make a movement decision once every *half*
// of a map cell's own width (`CoordRate=1`, `MapRate=2`), giving the
// walk-to-the-midpoint-then-commit rhythm the line-drawing mechanic
// depends on. Kept as the real expressions (not resolved to their current
// literal values) matching gameCracky.c's own "#defines should stay
// exactly as upstream wrote them" preference - this also preserves one
// genuinely degenerate-but-load-bearing upstream quirk: `CoordMask` (used
// in `MoveMonsters()`'s own per-tick gate for `DecideDirection()`)
// evaluates to a literal `0`, making that gate always true (`DecideDirection`
// re-evaluates every single tick, not just on cell-boundary ticks) - kept
// exactly as upstream has it rather than "corrected" into a real gate.
//
// `struct CacActor { CacMovable mv; int dx, dy, status; }` - a genuine
// struct-of-struct composition (not a flattened C++ class hierarchy the
// way Tiny Missile's/Tiny Pipe's own class ports needed), matching
// upstream's real `struct Actor { Movable _; ... }` shape directly.
// Confirmed safe before use: this project's own `gameBootskell.c`
// (`struct BskMonster { BskMovable m; ... }`) already ships this exact
// nested-struct-field pattern, including `&x.m`/`pMonster->m.field`-style
// addressing - not a first-of-its-kind risk. Field renamed from upstream's
// own bare `_` to `mv` for clarity; `Actor.clock` (declared upstream,
// confirmed via a project-wide grep to be read/written nowhere at all) is
// dropped as confirmed-dead, matching this project's own "confirm dead
// code via grep before dropping it" precedent.
//
// One further, genuinely dead upstream helper was found and NOT ported,
// matching that same precedent: `Line.cpp`'s own `Trace(byte old, bool
// erase)` takes an `old` parameter that is only ever assigned `0` inside
// the function body and never read again afterward (a real, harmless,
// vestigial leftover) - `cacTrace()` drops the parameter entirely
// (`bool erase` only), with every one of its 3 real call sites (both
// inside `cacGrowEnteringLine()`) preserved exactly, including the one
// whose own return value is genuinely discarded (`cacTrace(true)` called
// purely for its walk-and-erase side effect, matching upstream's own
// `Trace(cell, false)` structure, whose own discarded-return-value call
// is otherwise a complete no-op given the confirmed-dead `old` parameter -
// kept as a literal, safe, zero-risk translation rather than guessed-at
// as removable, since an intricate loop-closing algorithm like this one
// is exactly the kind of code this project's own precedent says to
// mirror structurally rather than re-derive).
//
// `Line.cpp`'s own `MaskBytes[]` table (`~Line_Right` etc, real bitwise-
// NOT of a small constant) is ported as pre-computed literal negative
// decimal values (`-3`, `-2`, `-9`, `-5`) rather than using the `~`
// operator directly inside a global array initializer, since no existing
// port in this project was confirmed to exercise that specific
// combination - Vircon32's own documented two's-complement `int`
// semantics (matching this project's own signed-sentinel bug findings
// elsewhere) confirm a negative mask value ANDs correctly regardless of
// how it's spelled, so this is a zero-risk, zero-behavior-change spelling
// choice, not a workaround for a real problem.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A later, meticulous re-verification pass (this game had originally only
// been test-compiled, never played/screenshot-tested) - re-traced every
// upstream `.h`/`.cpp` file line by line, byte-diffed every data table
// against a fresh Python extraction (all matched on the first attempt: the
// two font/tile tables, all 9 melody tables including both 119/133-note BGM
// tracks, the 32-entry RNG table, and all 8 stages' own start/item/enemy/
// wall-byte data), and actually launched and played the built ROM via a
// Puppeteer/WebGL harness. Two real bugs were found and fixed:
//
// 1) **A real, visible title-screen rendering bug** (original finding,
//    later fully superseded - see the "wrong text-layout model" section
//    at the very end of this header comment, added after a real user-
//    supplied hardware photo overturned the diagnosis below) - confirmed
//    via a live screenshot showing garbled text: page3 read "MINIE  1"
//    instead of "MINI", and page5 read ">START 0" instead of ">START".
//    Original root-cause diagnosis: `cacBeginTitle()` called the FULL
//    `cacPrintStatus()` (which writes "STAGE"+the stage-number digit into
//    page3, and "TIME"+the countdown digits into page5) and THEN wrote
//    this port's own 5-line title text ("MINI" into page3, "START" into
//    page5) over the SAME two rows, without clearing either one first -
//    the title text only partially overwrote what PrintStatus had just
//    written, leaving stray leftover characters bleeding through (the "E"
//    from "STAGE", the stage-number "1", and a leftover ones-digit of
//    `cacStageTime`). **Original (now-superseded) fix**: a
//    `cacPrintStatusForTitle()` stripped-down status print used only by
//    the title screen, showing just SCORE and the lives digit, in place
//    of the full `cacPrintStatus()` - this "worked" only by accident, by
//    happening to never print the two colliding rows at all, not by
//    actually placing anything at its real, correct column. **This
//    diagnosis was wrong** - see the final section of this header comment
//    for the real bug (a `cacStatusChar` grid modeled far too narrow) and
//    the real fix (widen the grid, use upstream's own real, literal
//    columns, restore the full `cacPrintStatus()`).
//
// 2) **A real rendering-fidelity gap: the "you just closed a loop" red
//    line flash was computed but never actually visible.** Traced by
//    reading `GrowEnteringLine()`'s real control flow against
//    `VVramToVram()`/`DrawAll()`: upstream sets `LineRed = true;
//    DrawAll();` (a genuine hardware flush - the red line really is on
//    screen at that instant), then calls the *blocking* `Sound_Beep()`
//    (holding that red frame visible for real wall-clock time while it
//    plays), then `EraseItems()` (each captured item's own blocking
//    `Sound_Hit()` holding it further still), and only resets
//    `LineRed = false` at the very end with no further `DrawAll()` -
//    meaning the red highlight stays on real hardware until whatever
//    redraw happens next. This port's own non-blocking Sound_Beep
//    simplification (a deliberate, otherwise-correct choice - see this
//    file's own note on it further above) removed the only thing that
//    was ever holding that red frame visible: since nothing here blocks,
//    `cacLineRed` got set true then immediately false again within the
//    SAME real engine tick, and since `cacRender()` (the actual screen
//    push) only ever fires once per tick, at the very end, the red flash
//    was computed into `cacVVram` and then unconditionally overwritten
//    before the frame was ever actually shown - completely invisible,
//    even though item capture/scoring/wall-formation all still worked
//    correctly underneath it. **Fixed** by deferring the final cleanup
//    (`cacLineRed = false; cacTrace( true ); cacLinePrevX/Y = ...;`)
//    instead of running it synchronously: `cacGrowEnteringLine()` now
//    leaves `cacLineRed` true and arms `cacLineFlashHold` (a new global,
//    `CAC_LINE_FLASH_FRAMES = 18` real frames ~= 300ms) instead;
//    `cacUpdatePlaying()` holds the game genuinely paused for that many
//    real frames (matching upstream's own real single-threaded freeze
//    during its blocking sound calls - no monster movement, no time
//    decrement, no death/clear checks run during the hold) with the red
//    line actually rendered, then performs the deferred cleanup on the
//    frame the hold expires. The fixed duration is a deliberate,
//    documented approximation of upstream's own variable-length real-
//    hardware pause (rather than trying to reproduce it note-for-note),
//    matching this project's own established "downsample a variable
//    real-hardware-timed sequence to a fixed, clearly-visible hold"
//    precedent (e.g. `CAC_STATE_CLEAR_WAIT`'s own fixed 10-frame pause).
//    Verified two ways: first with a throwaway debug hook (forcing the
//    hold immediately at gameplay start) that confirmed the deferred
//    cleanup path genuinely executes and doesn't itself crash the engine
//    - it DID crash, but only because the hook injected a raw cell value
//    without maintaining the `cacLineFirstX/Y`/`cacLineLastX/Y` invariant
//    `cacTrace()` depends on, an artifact of the crude hook rather than
//    the real fix (removed once its diagnostic purpose was served); then,
//    properly, by computing an exact loop-closing move sequence offline
//    against stage 1's real wall data (`LEFT,LEFT,UP,LEFT,DOWN,RIGHT`
//    from the man's own start cell) and playing it out live - the loop
//    closed with no crash, a wide-area pixel diff confirmed the whole
//    drawn line path's own rendered pattern changed at the moment of
//    closure (consistent with `cacLineRed` flipping true and affecting
//    every line-glyph cell at once, not just the newly-closed segment),
//    `cacStageTime` correctly stayed frozen throughout the hold and
//    resumed counting down normally right after, and movement/rendering
//    continued working correctly afterward with no corruption.
//
// Everything else audited and confirmed correct, not just skipped: every
// position/offset formula in `cacComposeRawByte()`/`cacMapToVVram()`/
// `cacDrawSpritesIntoVVram()` traced against upstream's own `SendUL()`/
// `VPut2C()`/`DrawSprites()` byte-for-byte; the entire state machine
// (title -> start jingle -> playing -> lose-anim -> retry-or-gameover ->
// clear-wait -> clear-jingle -> bonus-tally -> next stage) traced against
// `Main()`'s real goto-chain label by label, including which resets
// (`Score`/`CurrentStage`/`RemainCount`/`StageTime`/`Clock`/`monsterNum`/
// `timeDenom`) happen at which shared label and in which order; a project-
// wide grep confirmed no upstream global or struct member anywhere in this
// game has a non-zero initializer needing an explicit match (unlike Tiny
// Gilbert's own `visible=1` bug elsewhere in this project); and the
// `Cell_Wall`/`x<0`/`y<0` bounds-guard fix already documented above was
// re-confirmed still correct and still the only place needing it.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// **A real user-supplied hardware photo of the sibling gameCracky.c
// overturned the "title text collides with status labels" diagnosis
// above, and the identical wrong-model bug was found and fixed here
// too.** Upstream's real `PrintC()`/`PrintS()` write to a genuinely
// whole-screen-wide Vram address space (32 real 4-pixel char cells per
// page row), not a narrow 8-cell sidebar - `Status.cpp`'s own `LeftX=24`
// constant really does confine SCORE/STAGE/TIME/lives to columns 24-31,
// but every piece of the title screen's own text (checked directly
// against this game's own real `Status.cpp::Title()`) lives at DIFFERENT,
// LOWER columns: the simplified logo replacement at (an arbitrary, non-
// colliding) col 2/page 2, "MINI" at real col 17/page 3, "INUFUTO 2026"
// at real col 12/page 7, "START" at real col 9/page 5 (cursor col 8), and
// "CONTINUE" at real col 9/page 6 (cursor col 8) - all genuinely clear of
// columns 24-31, using the exact same shared `PrintC()`/`PrintS()`
// mechanism at different column arguments, not a separate, narrower grid.
// This port's own `cacStatusChar` had been modeled as only `int[8][8]`
// (just the status-label columns) and then had ALL of the title screen's
// own text crammed into that same 8-cell-wide grid too - reusing the same
// columns 24-31 the status labels also use - which is what caused the
// real collision found in section 1) above; the original fix
// (`cacPrintStatusForTitle()`, skipping the two colliding status rows
// entirely) treated the symptom, not the cause, and also meant
// "INUFUTO"/"CONTINUE" had to stay cropped to "INUFUTO"/"CONTINU" since
// there was genuinely no room left in the cramped 8-column model.
// **Fixed** the identical way as gameCracky.c: `cacStatusChar` widened to
// `int[8][32]`, every status-label print call switched to upstream's
// real, literal columns (`+24` from the old local offsets - a pure
// relabeling, the underlying values were already correct), every title-
// screen print call moved to upstream's own real, literal columns
// (restoring the full, uncropped "INUFUTO 2026" and "CONTINUE" text), a
// new `cacFullWidthText` flag (true only during `CAC_STATE_TITLE`) makes
// `cacComposeRawByte()` read the full 32-column range from
// `cacStatusChar` instead of just the narrow 24-31 status slice, and
// `cacPrintStatusForTitle()` is removed entirely - the title screen now
// calls the same, full `cacPrintStatus()` gameplay uses, since nothing it
// prints collides with the title's own text anymore. Proactively applied
// gameCracky.c's own separately-documented stale-status-text lesson here
// too, rather than waiting for a report: `cacBeginTitle()` now resets
// `cacStageTime = 0` before printing status (upstream's own `StageTime`
// can be genuinely nonzero at the `goto title;` reached via a monster-
// collision death mid-countdown, not just the `StageTime==0` time-up
// path, which would otherwise leave a stale TIME value on the title
// screen the exact same way gameCracky.c's own TIME display once did).
// Verified via a clean rebuild and a live screenshot (see the commit/PR
// history for this fix) showing every title-screen element - SCORE,
// STAGE, TIME, the CACORM logo text, MINI, the full INUFUTO 2026 credit,
// START/CONTINUE with their own cursor, and the lives digit - all visible
// simultaneously with no overlap and no truncation.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// **A second architectural issue found in the sibling gameCracky.c, and
// fixed here too by direct mirror.** After the wide-grid fix above shipped,
// re-reading gameCracky.c's own `Status.cpp::Title()` for that game found
// its own logo was never actually a "purely decorative, safe to simplify"
// element - it's the single largest, most prominent piece of content on
// the whole title screen, and the small 27-glyph ASCII font used for the
// text substitute is missing several letters (no L/H/Y/W/D/K), which is
// why gameCracky.c's own earlier "CRACKY" text substitute rendered as
// "CRAC" with gaps. gameCracky.c was fixed to draw its own real
// `TitleBytes[]` pixel-art bitmap directly into `VVram` instead of
// substituting text, with `crkComposeRawByte()` updated to OR-combine the
// VVram-derived logo byte with the status-text byte (safe since the two
// occupy disjoint hardware pages by construction).
//
// This game's own logo text substitute ("CACORM", all ASCII, no missing
// glyphs) never actually rendered with gaps the way gameCracky.c's did,
// but the underlying design flaw is identical: upstream's own real
// `Title()` (see `more games/UIAPduino_cacorm/Status.cpp`) draws a
// genuine pixel-art "Cacorm" wordmark (5 letter-cells x 4x4 VVram-cell
// glyphs, `TitleBytes[]`, 80 values) as the biggest element on the title
// screen, not a plain-text label - simplifying it to text was the same
// unwarranted judgment call gameCracky.c's own header comment now
// documents as wrong. **Fixed the identical way**: added `cacTitleBytes`
// (byte-diff-verified via a small Python script against the real
// `Status.cpp::Title()` source - 80 values, all in range 0-15, confirmed
// valid indices into `cacCharPattern`'s own already-verified "logo" range,
// which was independently re-checked against `Chars.cpp` and confirmed
// byte-identical to gameCracky.c's own logo range - no fix needed there),
// drew it directly into `cacVVram` at upstream's own real position
// (`VVram + VVramWidth*2 + TitleLeft`, i.e. VVram row 2, columns
// `2..21` - `TitleLeft = (24 - 4*5)/2 = 2`, matching upstream's own
// `TitleLength=5` exactly, real hardware pages 1-2), and removed the
// `cacPrintS(2,2,sCacorm,6)` plain-text substitute and its now-unused
// `sCacorm` local entirely. `cacComposeRawByte()` was restructured from
// an exclusive if/else (map byte OR status-text byte, never both) into
// the same OR-combine gameCracky.c's own `crkComposeRawByte()` uses -
// `MINI`'s own real column (17, already correct pre-fix: upstream's
// `TitleLeft + 4*TitleLength - 5 = 2+20-5 = 17`) needed no change.
// Verified via a compile-only check (`compile src/main.c`, per explicit
// instruction not to play-test this change) confirming a clean build with
// no errors; the real visual result (the logo bitmap rendering correctly
// alongside SCORE/STAGE/TIME/MINI/INUFUTO 2026/START/CONTINUE/lives with
// no overlap) was not independently screenshot-verified this pass and is
// worth a direct check.

//
// **A real rendering-fidelity bug, found and fixed during a later
// verification pass**: upstream sets `LineRed = true; DrawAll();` (a real
// hardware flush - the red line is genuinely visible on the physical OLED
// at that exact moment) then calls the *blocking* `Sound_Beep()`, which
// holds that red frame on screen for real wall-clock time while it plays,
// then processes `EraseItems()` (each captured item's own blocking
// `Sound_Hit()` holding the still-red frame visible further still), and
// only resets `LineRed = false` at the very end - with no further
// `DrawAll()` afterward, so the red line stays visible on real hardware
// until the *next* natural redraw. This port originally fired the beep
// non-blocking (correctly, per this file's own header comment on that
// simplification) but then, since nothing gates *rendering itself* the
// same way a blocking call would, immediately reset `cacLineRed = false`
// and returned - all within the SAME real engine tick whose own single
// `cacRender()` call happens only once, at the very end of
// `cacUpdatePlaying()`. The net effect: the red highlight was computed
// into `cacVVram` and then unconditionally overwritten before the frame
// was ever actually pushed to the screen - the "you just closed a loop"
// visual feedback was completely invisible, even though item capture/
// scoring/wall-formation all still worked correctly underneath it.
// **Fixed** by deferring the final cleanup (`cacLineRed = false;
// cacTrace( true ); cacLinePrevX/Y = ...;`) instead of running it
// synchronously here - `cacLineRed` is left `true` (and the just-closed
// boundary cells are left un-erased, so they keep rendering as red line
// glyphs) and `cacLineFlashHold` is armed instead; `cacUpdatePlaying()`
// holds the game genuinely paused (matching upstream's own real
// single-threaded freeze during its blocking sound calls - no monster
// movement, no time decrement, no death/clear checks) for
// `CAC_LINE_FLASH_FRAMES` real frames with the red line actually
// rendered, then performs the deferred cleanup on the frame the hold
// expires. The fixed hold duration is a deliberate, documented
// approximation of upstream's own variable-length real-hardware pause
// (Sound_Beep's own duration, plus one Sound_Hit-length pause per
// captured item) rather than an attempt to reproduce it exactly note-for-
// note - matching this project's own established "downsample a variable
// real-hardware-timed sequence to a fixed, clearly-visible hold" precedent
// used elsewhere (e.g. CAC_STATE_CLEAR_WAIT's own fixed 10-frame pause).
