// ASCEND mini (UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, Cate engine, license "None specified"
// - no LICENSE file in the upstream repo) - a vertically-scrolling climbing
// platformer: climb ladders/floors up a tall multi-floor tower, dodging
// falling "Fire" hazards (some carrying a 1-up or a temporary invincibility
// "Power" pickup) and patrolling ground Monsters, reaching the top floor
// (world Y < 2) to clear the stage. Jumping (Fire button) pushes a nearby
// Block up one row for ~2 real ticks, which can wall off a Monster's own
// path (CanMove() treats a raised block as a wall) - the "push blocks up to
// trap monsters" mechanic from the upstream readme. 10 hand-authored stages
// (heights 4-10 floors), 3 lives, real persistent hi-score tracked in-
// session (upstream has no EEPROM at all - a CH32V003 RISC-V microcontroller,
// not AVR, so this project's own `eeprom_*` shim/avrCompat widening aren't
// relevant here, matching this project's own sibling Cate-engine ports).
//
// Same Cate-engine lineage as this project's own already-shipped Cracky
// port (real SSD1306 display streamed one raw byte at a time, `SendOledData`,
// no framebuffer - the exact model `md_drawColumn()` already handles; a
// real explicit 60Hz SysTick-based frame limiter, `Timer.cpp`'s own
// `kTimerHz=60`/`WaitTimer(t)`, so no Tiny-Arkanoid-style speed-mismatch
// risk despite the unrelated RISC-V host). Only 4 directions + 1 action
// button (`ScanKeys.h`'s own `Keys_Button0`) - a strict subset of what
// `tinyJoypadShim.h` already exposes, so no new shim primitive was needed
// (isFire2Pressed() simply goes unused here, matching Cracky's own port).
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform is used, matching Cracky's
// own hard-won, directly-confirmed lesson** - `InitOled()` sends the exact
// same `OledCmd::RightToLeft`(SegRemap 0xA1)/`OledCmd::BottomToTop`
// (ComScanDec 0xC8) pair Cracky's own `InitOled()` does, and Cracky's own
// header comment already documents (after a real live-tested revert) that
// these settings exist to compensate for a physical panel-mounting quirk on
// specific real breakout modules, with nothing to compensate for in a
// software recreation. `ascComposeMapByte(col,page)`/`ascComposeStatusByte`
// are drawn directly at their own (col,page) - no column mirroring, no page
// reordering, no bit-reversal.
//
// **A genuinely new architectural piece versus Cracky: a scrolling window.**
// Unlike Cracky's fixed, non-scrolling 24x16 VVram, Ascend's own stage can
// be up to 10 floors (40 world-rows) tall while only 16 VVram rows are ever
// visible at once - `topY`/`topRow`/`yMod`/`topYRange` track the window's
// current vertical scroll offset (world-Y of the window's own top edge),
// updated by `ascScroll()`/`ascDrawBackground()` whenever the player's own Y
// changes. Upstream's real `byte topY`/`byte topRow` are BOTH capable of
// going genuinely negative near the very top of a stage (confirmed by
// tracing the real math: `newTopY = y - (WindowHeight/2) - FloorHeight`
// with `WindowHeight=16`/`FloorHeight=4` gives 12, and the win condition is
// reachable at world-Y as low as 0-1) - upstream relies on AVR `byte`
// wraparound for this ("if newTopY would go negative, wrap to a huge
// positive value >= topYRange, so the scroll-ratchet clamp correctly
// rejects it"), the exact byte-wraparound-as-a-bounds-trick pattern this
// whole project's own history has repeatedly had to re-derive as explicit
// signed-int logic instead (see CLAUDE.md's own documented bug family).
// Ported with `ascTopY`/`ascTopRow` as genuine signed ints allowed to go
// negative directly - no wraparound needed at all, since a real negative
// comparison against `topYRange` (itself always a small positive int)
// already produces the exact same accept/reject outcome the wraparound
// trick was faking. `ascGetCellType()`'s own `row = (y>>2)-1` can likewise
// go negative (reachable at low world-Y) - explicitly guarded with
// `row<0 -> return 0` (matching what the real AVR byte-wrap-then-
// `row>=height` check already produced) rather than trusting a wrap.
// `ascMapToBackground()`'s own `row` (derived from `ascTopRow`) is guarded
// the same way. `DrawSprites()`'s own `y = pSprite->y - topY` (again a real
// byte-wraparound-as-a-visibility-reject trick upstream, when a sprite sits
// above the current scroll window) is ported as a plain signed subtraction
// with an explicit `y>=0 && y<VVramHeight` bounds check instead of relying
// on wraparound to push an out-of-window sprite's `y` up past `VVramHeight`.
//
// **Two-level tile compositing, ported as a direct structural mirror rather
// than re-derived into a closed form** (the same "faithfully copy an
// intricate stateful algorithm's own shape" reasoning already used for
// Frogger's/Cracky's own compositing in this project): `MapToBackGround()`
// walks the decompressed `StageMap` (2-bit cell types, RLE-decompressed
// once per stage entry by `ascDecompressStageMap()`, mirroring `InitStage()`'s
// own real accumulator-based unpack) and, for each stage cell, combines
// *this* floor's cell type with the *next* floor's cell type (the shared
// floor-boundary tile) to pick one of a small number of fixed 4-row glyph
// patterns - re-derived here with fixed 0..3 row offsets per branch (every
// upstream branch, once traced by hand, always writes exactly
// `FloorHeight`(4) rows total regardless of which sub-branch fires - a
// genuine, confirmed invariant, not an assumption), which is considerably
// simpler than porting the original's own pointer-walking/y-position-
// bookkeeping version literally. `VVramToVram()`'s own nibble-interleaved
// 2-VVram-row-per-page packing (`SendUL()`) is the same math already
// proven in Cracky's own `crkComposeRawByte()` - reproduced here as a
// shared `ascComposeGlyphByte(topGlyph,bottomGlyph,sub)` helper, reused for
// both the scrolling map itself and the lives-icon overlay below (see next
// paragraph) rather than duplicated. Upstream's own `Backup[]` dirty-
// tracking (skip re-sending unchanged real I2C bytes) is dropped, matching
// this whole project's standing "always redraw the full frame" precedent
// (Cracky's own header comment lists half a dozen other ports that needed
// this same fix once discovered the hard way).
//
// **The status-bar "remaining lives" display needed a genuinely new
// mechanism beyond Cracky's own ascii-only status grid.** Upstream's
// `PrintStatus()` draws SCORE/STAGE/TIME labels and digits via the plain
// `AsciiPattern`-based `PrintC()`/`PrintS()` (a full-page-height, CharWidth
// -wide glyph per call - ported here as `ascPrintC`/`ascPrintS`, writing
// into an 8-page x 8-char-cell `ascStatusChar[][]` grid covering raw
// columns 96-127, the exact same "status area" convention already
// established by Cracky), but the lives count (when > 2) draws a real
// `Put2C(Char_Remain)` 2x2-icon-from-4-consecutive-glyph-codes composite -
// the exact same `CharPattern`/nibble-interleave format the *map* uses, not
// the simpler `AsciiPattern` format text uses elsewhere in the status bar.
// Traced `Put2C()`'s own byte-emission loop by hand to confirm it's really
// just this project's already-proven "2x2 icon from 4 consecutive glyph
// indices" sprite convention (`c`,`c+1` on top, `c+2`,`c+3` on the bottom),
// squeezed into one page (8px) x 8 raw columns via the identical
// `ascComposeGlyphByte()` nibble math already used for the map - so a
// dedicated `ascComposeLivesByte(relCol)`, gated to page 7 / raw columns
// 96-111 only, computes the icon(s) (`RemainCount-1` of them, up to 2) or,
// for `RemainCount>3`, one icon + a plain ascii space + an ascii digit
// (matching `PrintStatus()`'s own exact branching) directly from
// `ascComputeLivesDisplay()`'s precomputed `ascLivesMode`/`ascLivesIconCount`/
// `ascLivesDigit`, entirely bypassing the ascii-only status grid for that
// one sub-region rather than trying to force an icon into a text-only
// representation.
//
// **A second genuinely new mechanism versus Cracky: multiple simultaneous
// overlay slots, not just one.** Cracky's own single-slot
// `crkOverlayActive`/`crkOverlayText` overlay (for text drawn directly over
// the map area, matching upstream's own real-VRAM-persistence trick for
// `PrintTimeUp()`/`PrintGameOver()`) works because Cracky never needs two
// such off-status-grid texts on screen at once. Ascend's own title screen
// needs *five* simultaneously: the "MINI" sub-title (page3, raw col76,
// inside the map area under the big "ASCEND" logo), the "INUFUTO 2026"
// credit line (page7, raw col48), the static "START"/"CONTINUE" labels
// (page5/6, raw col36), and the blinking '>' selection cursor (page5/6, raw
// col32 - toggled between '>' and ' ' as two of the six slots, not a
// separate mechanism, so a selection change is just two `ascBeginOverlay()`
// calls). Generalized Cracky's own single-slot design into a fixed
// `ASC_MAX_OVERLAYS`(6) array, checked in sequence inside `ascRender()`'s
// per-pixel compose step - a small, constant per-pixel cost (6 bounds
// checks) rather than a real correctness risk, and the GAME OVER/TIME UP
// cues (which, like Cracky's own single-slot original, only ever need one
// slot each, never simultaneously with the title screen's own five) simply
// reuse slot 0. A minor, deliberate deviation from upstream's own literal
// VRAM-persistence behavior: on the rare path where TIME UP was the actual
// death cause *and* it was also the player's last life, upstream would
// visually show the two texts genuinely overlapping (`PrintTimeUp()`'s and
// `PrintGameOver()`'s real VRAM writes land on different, overlapping raw
// columns, with no clear-screen between them) - ported instead as `slot 0`
// being cleanly *replaced* (GAME OVER fully supersedes TIME UP, no visual
// garbling), matching this whole project's standing precedent of not
// reproducing a pure VRAM-persistence side effect that has no gameplay
// significance of its own.
//
// **Sound**: same real 3-tone-channel software mixer/tracker as Cracky
// (`Sound.cpp`, byte-for-byte identical `Tempo`(160)/`NoteLength`/`Scale`
// enums and `Frequencies[]` table - confirmed via direct comparison, not
// assumed from the shared engine alone) - every call routed to
// `md_playTone(freqHz, durationSeconds)` instead, the same reasoning as
// Cracky's own header comment (this shim's single-call AVR-buzzer-style
// `Sound()` wrapper is far thinner than upstream's real multi-voice
// tracker, and `md_playTone()` is itself already genuinely multi-voice
// project-wide, so 3 independent logical sequencer slots never actually
// fight over one shared channel). Each melody is ported as upstream's own
// literal `[duration,note]` byte-pair data (byte-diff-extracted via a
// small Python script parsing the real source directly, not hand-copied),
// resolved "by id" through `ascMelodyLength()`/`ascMelodyValue()` - the
// same "resolve by id instead of storing a real pointer" pattern already
// established project-wide (e.g. Tiny Dungeon's own bitmap-array
// resolver, Cracky's own melody resolver). `Sound_Item()` (the pickup
// jingle - genuinely new versus Cracky, no equivalent cue there) is the
// *only* upstream `Sound_*` call that isn't a blocking `WaitMelody()` -
// it's a real fire-and-forget `StartMelody(0,...)`, so `ascHitMan()` just
// starts it on channel 0 with no accompanying wait-state, unlike every
// other cue in this file which pairs a `ascStartSeq()` call with an
// `ascWaitFrames = ascNoteFrames(...)` state-machine pause to reproduce
// upstream's real blocking wait. Confirmed the two melodies shared between
// `Sound_Start()`/`StartBGM()`'s own channel-1 tune and Cracky's own
// identical-looking start jingle really are byte-for-byte the same 27-
// value sequence (both games apparently reuse this one composed intro) -
// re-extracted independently from Ascend's own real source rather than
// assumed, since `Sound_Clear()`/`Sound_GameOver()`/`StartBGM()`'s own
// channel-2 bass line all turned out to have real, if structurally
// similar, *different* note data than Cracky's own versions once actually
// compared value-by-value.
//
// **Movable coordinates are already expressed in VVram-cell-grid units
// directly** (`CoordShift=0`/`CoordRate=1` make upstream's own generic
// sub-cell-precision parameterization degenerate here, exactly like
// Cracky - confirmed by tracing `LocateMovable`-equivalent math, though
// Ascend has no such helper of its own; `ToX()`/`ToY()` already produce
// VVram-grid coordinates directly from a packed stage-data byte) - so
// sprites compositing directly into `ascVVram` (`ascDrawSpritesIntoVVram`,
// offset by the scroll window's own `ascTopY`) needed no extra scaling.
// Every genuinely degenerate-but-still-present upstream formula
// (`CoordRate`/`CoordMask`, `MaxTimeDenom`'s own `50/(8/CoordRate)`,
// `FireInterval`'s own `CoordRate*12`) is kept as the real expression
// rather than resolved to its current literal value, matching Cracky's
// own established "#defines should stay exactly as upstream wrote them"
// preference.
//
// **A genuinely intentional bit-value collision, preserved rather than
// "fixed"**: `Man_Jump`(0x40) and `Item_1Up`(0x40) share the exact same
// numeric value in upstream (two independently-purposed status flags on
// two different actor "kinds" that happen to collide) - `CanMove()`'s own
// `if((pActor->status & Man_Jump)!=0) --y;` check, when called with a Fire
// actor whose status has `Item_1Up` set instead, spuriously matches and
// offsets that fire's own collision-check row by one, purely from this bit
// coincidence. Confirmed by tracing every real call site that this is
// upstream's own actual, reachable behavior (not a porting slip) - ported
// with the literal same `0x40` constant reused for both flags, exactly as
// upstream does, rather than defining two textually-distinct-but-still-
// equal constants that might invite "fixing" the collision later.
//
// **Several intra-function `goto`s used purely as structured-control-flow
// shortcuts (jumping into a shared tail of an if/else-if chain from an
// earlier branch) were rewritten as duplicated inline blocks instead of
// literal gotos** - `TestMoveY()`'s own `up:`/`down:` labels (each reached
// from two different branches), `FallMan()`'s own `fall:`/`stop:` labels,
// and `HitMan()`'s own `get:` label (reached from both the 1-up and the
// Power item branches) - matching this project's own established
// preference for plain duplicated `if`/`else` blocks over intra-function
// goto, and `MoveMan()`'s own single `goto moved;` (skipping the Y-axis
// test entirely once the X-axis test succeeds against *fresh* input, but
// NOT when only the X-axis retry-with-stale-input succeeds - a real,
// subtle distinction traced carefully from the exact goto placement) is
// reproduced with a plain `bool skipRest` flag instead.
//
// A `JumpHeights[]` table (Man.cpp) and `Direction_Left`/`Direction_Right`
// constants (Actor.h) and a `DrawBlocks()` declaration (Block.h) are all
// confirmed dead by a project-wide grep (declared, never referenced
// anywhere) - not ported, matching this project's own established
// practice of dropping confirmed-dead code rather than translating it
// unused. `PrintPerfect()` (Status.cpp) is likewise declared and defined
// but never called from anywhere - also dropped.
// =============================================================================

// =============================================================================
// A dedicated, line-by-line re-verification pass against every real upstream
// source file (this game was originally ported in a large parallel batch and
// had only ever been test-compiled, never played) - found and fixed three
// real bugs, two of them genuinely serious.
//
// **Bug 1 - the scroll-window ratchet, exactly the piece this port's own
// header comment above had flagged as the highest-risk area, and exactly
// the piece it had gotten wrong.** The header's own claim ("a real negative
// comparison against topYRange...already produces the exact same accept/
// reject outcome the wraparound trick was faking") was checked by directly
// simulating upstream's real byte-wraparound arithmetic in Python across a
// full climb, and it does NOT hold: upstream's `if (newTopY != topY &&
// newTopY < topYRange)` (Man.cpp's `Scroll()`), with `newTopY` a real
// wrapping `byte`, REJECTS the update the instant the true (signed) result
// would go negative (which happens for every stage, once Man's world-Y
// drops below 12, well before the win condition at Y<2) - freezing `topY`
// at its last valid value (always exactly 0) for the remainder of the
// climb, because the window has by then already scrolled far enough to
// show the whole top of the tower. The ported signed-int version had NO
// such freeze - `newTopY` just kept counting down through genuinely
// negative values (as low as -11 on the tallest stage), and a negative
// `ascTopY` corrupts `ascMapToBackground()`'s own row/yPos bookkeeping
// (`ascYMod` grows away from 0 instead of freezing), leaving most of the
// visible window unrefreshed right as the player closes in on winning -
// exactly the kind of "certain games don't draw well" symptom this whole
// verification pass was commissioned to hunt for. **Fixed** by adding the
// missing `newTopY >= 0` guard to `ascScroll()`'s own condition,
// reproducing the wraparound-reject outcome exactly (verified byte-for-
// byte against a Python simulation before ever touching the port, and
// again live in the emulator afterward - see below). See `ascScroll()`'s
// own comment for the full derivation.
//
// **Bug 2 - a real, confirmed out-of-bounds array write.** The title
// screen's own "INUFUTO 2026" credit-line overlay (slot 1) is 12
// characters, but `ascOverlayTextTable` was declared `[ASC_MAX_OVERLAYS][10]`
// - 2 words too narrow. `ascBeginOverlay()`'s own copy loop had no bounds
// check, so the last 2 characters were written straight into the next
// slot's own row (silently clobbered again moments later by that slot's
// own real content, so no *lasting* corruption there) while leaving
// `ascOverlayLen[1]` itself set to the real, unclamped 12 - meaning
// `ascRender()` kept trying to read 2 genuinely out-of-bounds table
// entries every single frame the title screen was shown. **Fixed** by
// widening the array to 12 (the real known maximum across every string
// this file ever puts through it), matching this project's own "widen
// with real margin, not an arbitrary guess" precedent.
//
// **Bug 3 - a severe, previously entirely unaddressed CPU-budget overrun,
// found immediately while live-testing bug 2's own fix.** Confirmed via
// the WebGL perf overlay: `ascRender()` pegged CPU at a sustained,
// saturated 100% even on the completely static title screen (10fps
// instead of 60), with a directly visible consequence - a genuine,
// reproducible frame truncation (this project's own well-documented "CPU
// budget exceeded, execution literally stops mid-instruction-stream"
// signature) caught losing the trailing "E" of "CONTINUE" and the entire
// credit line on individual captured frames, independent of and in
// addition to bug 2's own array-bounds corruption. This function had
// never received any of the optimization techniques this project has
// applied to nearly every other game's own render loop - no per-row call-
// site gating, no composited buffers, no dirty-flag caching, a genuine
// O(pixels x overlay-slots) shape - because the whole file had only ever
// been compile-tested before, never actually run. Fixed in three layers,
// each measured before moving to the next (see each function's own
// comment for the full detail): (1) inlined `ascComposeGlyphByte()`
// directly into `ascComposeMapByte()`, its single hottest call site; (2)
// restructured `ascRender()`'s own overlay-matching loop to filter which
// of the (up to 6) overlay slots are even active on the CURRENT page
// once per page instead of re-scanning all 6 for every one of 1024
// pixels; (3) added a persistent per-pixel cache (`ascPixelCache`) plus a
// `ascFrameDirty` flag set at every real mutation site (`ascWriteCell`,
// `ascDrawSpritesIntoVVram`, `ascPrintC`, `ascComputeLivesDisplay`,
// `ascBeginOverlay`/`ascClearOverlays`, and defensively at the top of
// `ascBeginTrying()`/`ascBeginTitle()` for their own direct VVram/
// StatusChar writes) so the expensive composition work is only redone
// when something could actually have changed - **deliberately not** the
// "skip the whole draw call, previous frame just persists" shape several
// other games in this project use (e.g. Tiny Tris's own attract screen),
// since this game registers no `onResume` hook in `menuGameList.c` (its
// own `addGame()` call passes `NULL`) and fixing that is out of scope for
// this file alone - every real frame still issues all 1024
// `md_drawColumn()` calls unconditionally (cheap, and already proven fine
// at this volume by every other game in this project), reading from the
// cache instead of recomputing it, so a quit-confirmation-dialog resume
// (which can't force a redraw here) still reproduces the correct picture
// on its very next frame exactly like the original always-recompute
// version did - verified directly, see below. Measured before/after:
// static title screen 100%/10fps -> 17-71%/60fps; active gameplay
// (movement + climbing) 100%(implied, same saturated symptom observed) ->
// 64-65%/60fps.
//
// **Every other file/mechanism was checked and confirmed correct**,
// cross-verified line-by-line against the real upstream source (not just
// re-read from this port's own prior reasoning) rather than skipped:
// `MapToBackGround()`/`ascMapToBackground()`'s own tile-compositing
// (including the RLE decompression, byte-diffed against a from-scratch
// Python re-implementation of `InitStage()`'s real algorithm for all 10
// stages' real `Bytes/Enemies/Blocks` tables - all matched exactly, zero
// transcription errors this time); `DrawSprites()`/`ascDrawSpritesIntoVVram()`'s
// own byte-wraparound-as-visibility-reject trick (confirmed the signed
// `y>=0 && y<VVramHeight` translation is exactly equivalent for every
// realistic sprite/window-offset delta); `VVramToVram()`'s own nibble-
// interleaved `SendUL()` byte emission (traced by hand against
// `ascComposeGlyphByte()`'s own 4-way sub dispatch, confirmed identical
// column-by-column and page-by-page); `GetCellType()`/`IsOnFloor()`'s own
// AVR-wraparound-as-a-bounds-trick (confirmed the port's explicit
// `row<0`/negative-arithmetic handling reproduces both exactly, including
// the one case - `IsOnFloor()`'s own `(y-1)&3` at y=0 - where a genuinely
// negative signed int and a wrapped byte happen to agree by construction,
// not by luck); `Title()`'s own real layout (title-logo placement,
// "MINI"/credit/START/CONTINUE/cursor overlay positions, the `AsciiTable[]`
// character-index order) and its busy-wait-for-release debounce (correctly
// converted to edge-detection); `LooseMan()`'s own 8-step death loop and
// the exact point `Actor_Live`/`RemainCount` get updated relative to it;
// `Sound.cpp`'s entire note-data set (all 8 melodies, including the two
// 105-byte BGM tracks) byte-diffed against a fresh Python extraction -
// all matched exactly; every status-bar/lives-icon composite
// (`PrintStatus()`/`Put2C()`'s own 2x2-icon-from-4-glyphs convention,
// traced byte-for-byte against `ascComposeLivesByte()`). The apparent
// "lives icons visible on the attract screen" (2 small man-icons next to
// the credit line) is faithful to upstream, not a bug - `Title()` itself
// calls the same `PrintStatus()` gameplay uses, which upstream's own
// design never suppresses there either.
//
// **Verified live**, using an isolated Puppeteer/WebGL instance (own
// server, own copy of the WebBuild folder, cleaned up afterward): the
// menu (found and selected "ASCEND", confirmed "BY INUFUTO" credit), the
// attract screen (logo, MINI subtitle, START/CONTINUE + blinking cursor,
// and - after the fix - the complete, correctly-rendered "INUFUTO 2026"
// credit line), real input-driven gameplay (moving right along a floor,
// climbing a real ladder, an item pickup registering a score), and the
// quit-confirmation dialog opening over active gameplay and correctly
// resuming with no leftover dialog pixels (the specific risk the caching
// design above was built to avoid). The scroll-ratchet fix itself was
// proven two ways: mathematically, via a standalone Python re-
// implementation of both upstream's real byte-wraparound arithmetic and
// the port's exact fix, run across a full climb on the tallest (10-floor)
// stage; and live, via a temporary, fully-removed-afterward debug hook in
// `ascMoveMan()`/`ascFallMan()` that free-climbed Man straight up
// (bypassing maze/ladder navigation, which real monsters/fires made
// impractical to script reliably) - confirmed the window scrolled
// correctly and coherently through the entire danger zone (world-Y
// crossing 12, then 11, down to the win condition), reached the win
// condition cleanly, played the level-clear/bonus-tally sequence with
// correct score/time updates every step, and advanced to a fully-correct,
// newly-rendered Stage 2. `ASC_TICK_DIVISOR` was verified back at its
// real value (8) and the file compiles with zero warnings before/after
// every debug hook was removed.

// A real, confirmed bug: ascBeginOverlay()'s own copy loop wrote those last
// 2 characters straight past this array's row bound with no bounds check,
// landing on slot 2's own first 2 words (silently overwritten again moments
// later by slot 2's own real ascBeginOverlay(2,sStart,...) call, so no
// lasting corruption there) - but it also left ascOverlayLen[1] itself
// set to the full unclamped 12, so ascRender()'s per-column loop kept
// trying to index ascOverlayTextTable[1][10]/[11] every frame the title
// screen was shown. Confirmed visually via Puppeteer: the whole credit
// line rendered as fully blank (not just its last 2 characters truncated),
// not merely a 2-character glitch - fixed by widening to the real known
// maximum (12), matching this project's own "widen with real margin, not
// an arbitrary guess" precedent (e.g. the EEPROM nameTag bump).

// A real CPU-load fix, not a fidelity change (see ascRender()'s own header
// comment for the full writeup - a genuine, confirmed-via-live-play frame
// truncation, not a theoretical concern). ascRender() recomputed every one
// of 1024 pixels completely from scratch every single real 60fps frame,
// with no exception even while genuinely nothing on screen had changed
// (the whole static title screen, or a PLAYING-state frame that isn't one
// of the roughly-1-in-8 real frames where ASC_TICK_DIVISOR actually lets
// game logic run). `ascFrameDirty` gates the entire render call - matches
// this project's own established "skip the whole draw call, the previous
// frame simply persists on screen" pattern already used elsewhere (e.g.
// Tiny Tris's own attract-screen dirty flag) - set true at every real
// mutation site (ascWriteCell/ascDrawSpritesIntoVVram for ascVVram,
// ascPrintC for ascStatusChar, ascComputeLivesDisplay for the lives
// display fields, ascBeginOverlay/ascClearOverlays for the overlay
// system) plus, redundantly but safely, at the top of ascBeginTrying()/
// ascBeginTitle() themselves (both also write ascVVram/ascStatusChar
// directly, bypassing those helpers, for their own initial full-screen
// setup). Must start true (not the zero-initialized default) so the very
// first real frame after boot actually renders - set explicitly in
// gameAscend_init().

// A real, confirmed CPU-load bug, found via the exact same live-testing
// pass that caught the missing "CONTINUE" trailing "E"/missing credit
// line above: this loop originally re-scanned all ASC_MAX_OVERLAYS(6)
// slots for EVERY one of 1024 (page,col) pixels every single frame,
// regardless of how few of those slots could ever actually match a given
// page (at most 2 slots ever share a page in this file's own real usage,
// and their own column ranges never overlap). Fixed by building the list
// of slots active on the CURRENT page once per page (8x/frame) instead of
// once per pixel (1024x/frame) - `pageSlots`/`pageSlotCount` - and only
// checking that short filtered list per column. This is a pure iteration-
// count reduction: the filtered list is built by walking slots 0..5 in
// the same order the original per-pixel loop did, so a column matching
// more than one active slot on the same page (never happens today, but
// not assumed impossible) still resolves to whichever matching slot has
// the highest index, exactly like the original "keep overwriting `value`
// as later slots match" behavior - no rendering-order change, only cost.
// A persistent per-pixel cache backing ascRender()'s own dirty-flag fix -
// see that function's own header comment for the measured CPU numbers.
// Deliberately NOT the "skip the whole draw call, previous frame just
// persists" shape several other games in this project use (e.g. Tiny
// Tris's own attract screen) - this game registers no `onResume` hook in
// menuGameList.c (its own addGame() call passes NULL, and fixing that is
// out of scope for this file alone), so the quit-confirmation dialog has
// no way to force a redraw when it closes. Skipping real draw calls on a
// "nothing changed" frame would leave the dialog's own leftover pixels on
// screen indefinitely after resuming into a state (e.g. the static TITLE
// screen) that might never naturally re-dirty itself again. Instead,
// every real frame still calls md_beginFrame() and issues all 1024
// md_drawColumn() calls unconditionally (cheap and already proven fine at
// this volume by every other game in this project) - only the genuinely
// expensive part, recomputing what each of those 1024 bytes actually IS,
// is skipped when ascFrameDirty is false, reusing the previous pass's own
// cached results instead. This reproduces the exact same visual output as
// the original always-recompute version on every single frame, dialog-
// resume included, just without redoing the expensive compute work when
// nothing could have changed it.
