// =============================================================================
// MAZY2 mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, license "None specified" -
// GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_mazy2`) - a maze game: find
// the exit hidden somewhere in a multi-floor maze while dodging wandering
// monsters, picking up knives off the floor and throwing them (in whichever
// direction you're currently facing/moving) to destroy monsters that get in
// the way. 8 hand-authored stages (2-5 floors each, connected by paired up/
// down staircases), 3 lives, no persistent hi-score (upstream's own
// `HiScore` tracking is entirely commented out in the real source - not a
// gap this port needs to fill, matches the shipped game exactly).
//
// Same CH32V003+SSD1306 UIAPduino hardware/driver lineage as the sibling
// port `gameCracky.c` (same author, same real 60Hz SysTick frame limiter
// via `Timer.cpp`'s `kTimerHz=60`/`WaitTimer(t)`, same `ScanKeys.h` 4-
// direction+1-button input, same `Oled.cpp`/`Vram.cpp`/`VVram.cpp` display
// stack) - this port follows Cracky's own already-proven methodology
// directly rather than re-deriving it. Only 4 directions + 1 action button
// (`Keys_Button0`), a strict subset of what `tinyJoypadShim.h` already
// exposes - no new shim primitive needed, `isFire2Pressed()` unused.
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform applied, on purpose** -
// `InitOled()` sends the exact same `OledCmd::RightToLeft`/`BottomToTop`
// register commands Cracky's own `InitOled()` does, and Cracky's own
// session already spent significant effort discovering (via a real
// reference photo) that these settings do NOT need replicating in
// software at all: they exist on real hardware to compensate for a
// physical panel-mounting quirk specific to that module, with nothing
// equivalent to correct for in a software recreation. The composed byte
// is drawn directly at its own `(col,page)` - no column mirror, no page
// reversal, no bit-reversal table.
//
// **Rendering is the same genuine two-level tile system as Cracky's own
// port, ported as a direct structural mirror rather than re-derived into
// a closed form** - `VVram` is a 25x16 logical glyph-index grid; pairs of
// vertically-stacked VVram cells pack into 4 real output bytes via a
// 2-byte-per-glyph `CharPattern` lookup and the same nibble-interleaving
// `crkComposeRawByte()` already established (`mz2ComposeMapByte()` here).
// Two real structural differences from Cracky, both kept faithful to
// upstream rather than simplified away:
//   - Upstream keeps a genuinely separate `VVramBack` (the static per-
//     floor map, rebuilt only on `InitFloor()`, i.e. once per floor entry)
//     and `VVramFront` (a fresh working copy composited with sprites/
//     points every `DrawAll()` call) - kept as the real Back/Front split
//     here (`mz2VVramBack`/`mz2VVramFront`), rather than Cracky's own
//     choice to fully rebuild one combined VVram from scratch every
//     frame. Cracky's map (a flat 12x4 grid) is cheap enough to redo in
//     full every tick; this game's own map render additionally runs a
//     real flood-fill visibility scan (see below) that's genuinely
//     expensive to repeat every frame - keeping upstream's own caching
//     split is the right call here, not a fidelity shortcut.
//   - Both `VVramBack` and `VVramFront` are flat `int[400]` arrays
//     (`VVramWidth*VVramHeight`, matching upstream's own real
//     `VVramOffset(x,y)=y*VVramWidth+x` addressing exactly, via a shared
//     `mz2VOffset()` helper) rather than a 2D array the way Cracky's own
//     `crkVVram[height][width]` is - `InitFloor()`'s own map-render
//     routine and `Title()`'s own logo render are both genuinely
//     stateful pointer-walk algorithms (advance N, back up M, etc, with
//     dozens of non-uniform relative offsets) that are far safer to
//     literally mirror with a linear cursor index than to re-derive as
//     row/col math - "faithfully copy an intricate stateful algorithm's
//     own shape rather than re-derive a closed form", per this project's
//     own established precedent (Frogger's own row-buffer compositing;
//     Cracky's own VVram-packing header comment states the same
//     reasoning for the *packing* half of this same system).
//
// **Status/UI text lives in ONE unified whole-screen overlay grid,
// architecturally simpler than Cracky's own two-tier design** - Cracky
// needed a `crkStatusChar[8][8]` grid scoped ONLY to its rightmost status
// columns *plus* a separate `crkOverlayActive`/`crkOverlayText` mechanism
// for the one GAME OVER/TIME UP message that lands inside the *map*
// area - because this game's own always-on status labels (SCORE/STAGE/
// TIME/lives/held-knife-count) sit at a fixed `LeftX=24` (raw pixel 96+)
// *and* its GAME OVER/TIME UP messages, *and* its title screen's own
// "MINI" text, all land at genuinely different, sometimes-overlapping-
// with-the-map raw columns, this port instead uses ONE `mz2StatusChar
// [8][32]` grid spanning the *entire* screen width (32 4px-wide "text
// cells"), where a per-cell sentinel of -1 means "transparent, show
// the VVram-derived map content here" and any other value (0-26) is a
// real `AsciiPattern` glyph index overriding the map for that one cell.
// `mz2ComposeMapByte()` is consulted only when a cell's own status entry
// is -1. This absorbs Cracky's two separate mechanisms into one, and -
// since `mz2ClearScreen()` (called both entering the title screen and
// entering real gameplay, matching upstream's own two `ClearScreen()`
// call sites) resets the *whole* grid back to -1 - this proactively
// avoids the exact "stale overlay text bleeds into the next screen" bug
// class Cracky's own session found and had to fix via a live user
// report (see Cracky's own `crkInitTrying()` comment) rather than
// needing a report here first.
//
// **One genuine exception, kept OUTSIDE the unified status grid on
// purpose**: `PrintHeldKnives()` draws its 4 knife-icon slots via
// upstream's own `PutU()` (a *single-height* `CharPattern`-tile glyph,
// not an `AsciiPattern` text glyph - a different font table entirely),
// spaced a real 5 real pixels apart (`VramStep(4)+1`) rather than the
// 4px-per-cell grid every other status element uses. Reproducing that
// exact 1px inter-icon gap would need genuine sub-cell positioning this
// port's whole-screen 4px-cell grid can't represent - simplified to
// plain 4px-cell-tight packing instead (a purely cosmetic difference for
// a small decorative inventory row, the same class of "drop a minor
// exact-pixel-spacing detail for a non-gameplay-critical HUD element"
// simplification already used elsewhere in this project), handled by a
// small dedicated `mz2HeldKnifeIcons[4]` array and a direct composer
// branch in `mz2Render()` rather than routed through the ascii-glyph
// status grid at all (the held-knife icon *is* a `CharPattern` glyph,
// not text).
//
// **The maze's own real, working "fog of war" visibility system is
// ported with the SAME converged result, but a cheaper algorithm
// shape**: upstream's own flood-fill (`InitFloor()`'s trailing block)
// restarts its *entire* 40-cell scan from index 0 the instant any single
// cell visited during a pass causes a new cell to become queued
// (`if (changed) goto loop;`, mid-scan, not just at the end of a full
// pass) - a real, if inefficient, algorithm. The *final* set of visible
// cells this converges to is a pure function of maze connectivity from
// the seed cell, independent of *how* the scan is ordered or how often
// it restarts - so `mz2FloodFillVisibility()` instead does the
// standard, cheaper "repeat one full pass over all cells until a pass
// makes no changes" shape, converging to the *identical* final Visible
// set with far fewer redundant re-scans - not a shortcut on the game's
// own real behavior, just a cheaper way to compute the same fixed point.
// The eventual read of `mz2CellMap[idx +/- ColumnCount]` at a maze
// boundary (row 0's own top-neighbor, row 4's own bottom-neighbor, etc)
// is guarded defensively in `mz2SetCellVisible()` even though a direct
// check of every one of the 28 real floors' own raw wall-encoding bytes
// confirmed the outer boundary is always genuinely walled in every stage
// (so the guard is verified-unreachable for the real shipped level data,
// kept anyway as a cheap safety net against any future data edit, matching
// this project's own repeated "preserve behavior, guard the crash" caution
// for boundary reads whose safety depends on data rather than the
// algorithm's own structure).
//
// **`Movable`/`Man`/`Monster`/`Knife` classes flattened to plain structs +
// `mz2`-prefixed free functions taking an explicit pointer** (Man's own
// extra `pDirection` field became a separate `mz2ManDirIndex` global
// rather than a struct field, since nothing else in `Movable` needs it) -
// the same treatment already established across this whole project's
// C++-class ports. The multi-floor `Stage`/`Floor` struct hierarchy
// (a `Stage` holding a `count+pointer` to its own `Floor` array, each
// `Floor` itself holding `count+pointer` fields for its own stairs/
// monsters/knives) was flattened into parallel flat tables addressed by
// a single contiguous "global floor index" spanning all 8 stages'
// combined 28 floors (`mz2StageFloorStart[stage]+floorWithinStage`),
// each with its own `start+count` pair into one shared flat data array
// per resource kind (`mz2AllStairs`/`mz2AllMonsters`/`mz2AllKnives`) -
// the same "flatten struct-with-pointer-members into parallel arrays"
// precedent already established by Cracky's own `Stage` flattening, just
// one level deeper here since this game's own real per-floor structure
// genuinely has variable-length sub-lists nested inside a variable-length
// floor list, not a single fixed list. All data tables (glyph patterns,
// stage/floor/stair/monster/knife tables, sound melody tables) were
// byte-diff-extracted via small Python scripts against the real upstream
// source before ever building, not hand-transcribed - the stair/monster/
// knife arrays specifically use real `(col<<4)|row` / `0x02`-style C
// expressions rather than plain literals, so the first extraction attempt
// (a naive hex/decimal regex) silently mis-extracted every individual
// operand as a separate value instead of evaluating the whole expression
// - caught immediately by comparing the extracted array lengths against
// each floor's own declared `stairCount`/`monsterCount`/`knifeCount`
// (every single array mismatched), fixed by evaluating each comma-
// separated C expression properly before trusting any of it.
//
// **CoordRate=1 in this shipped build** (`CoordShift=0`, matching
// Cracky's own identical setup) makes every literal `((x|y)&CoordMask)==0`
// check upstream performs trivially always-true - kept literal rather
// than simplified away, matching Cracky's own stated "keep #defines/
// expressions exactly as upstream wrote them" preference; the *real*,
// position-varying alignment check (`CoordMod(x)==0`) is kept as an
// actual lookup-table port (`mz2CoordModTable`/`mz2ToGridTable`, both
// literally transcribed 32-entry tables, not re-derived formulas) rather
// than risk a subtly-wrong hand-derived replacement for a table whose
// exact boundary behavior (a `-1` sentinel for an unreachable input) this
// port doesn't need to independently re-verify is safe.
//
// **Sound**: the same real 3-tone-channel software mixer as Cracky's own
// `Sound.cpp` (`Tempo=220` here, not Cracky's 160 - a different tempo
// constant, so `mz2NoteFrames()`'s own derived multiplier differs:
// `SoundHandler()`'s real cadence is `(600/2)/Tempo = 300/220 ~= 1.364`
// real 60Hz ticks per channel-advance, vs Cracky's own `1.875`). Every
// upstream `Sound_*()` call routes to `md_playTone(freqHz, durationSeconds)`
// via the same small frame-stepped, id-resolved sequencer shape already
// established for Cracky (3 independent voices: 0=one-shot SFX, 1=jingle/
// BGM-voice-A, 2=BGM-voice-B - advancing every real engine frame,
// independent of `MZ2_TICK_DIVISOR`). Two of upstream's own `Sound_*()`
// calls (`Sound_Loose`, `Sound_Beep`) are real *blocking* `WaitMelody()`
// calls on real hardware - each gets its own explicit wait-state in this
// port's state machine (`mz2WaitFrames = mz2NoteFrames(1)`, plus the
// bonus-tally state's own extra literal `WaitTimer(3)` folded directly
// into that same wait value - `mz2NoteFrames(1)+3` - since upstream's own
// `Sound_Beep(); WaitTimer(3);` pair, unlike Cracky's own equivalent
// bonus-tally step which has no separate trailing wait at all, genuinely
// adds a second, independent real-time delay after the note finishes).
// `Sound_Hit`/`Sound_Get` are real non-blocking `StartMelody()` calls on
// real hardware and stay non-blocking here too (fire-and-forget
// `mz2StartSeq()` calls with no associated wait state).
//
// **`ChangeFloor()`'s own extra `DrawAll()` call, right before actually
// switching floors, is dropped rather than reproduced** - a deliberate
// simplification, not an oversight. On real hardware this call performs
// a genuine, comparatively slow synchronous I2C transfer that visibly
// updates the physical display for a real, non-negligible slice of wall-
// clock time *before* the very next line of code (re)builds the new
// floor's own map data - so a human eye really does catch that
// intermediate "old floor, man standing on the stair" frame before the
// screen cuts to the new floor. On this engine, drawing more than once
// within a single `update()` call has no such effect: nothing is ever
// actually *presented* to the screen until the frame ends, so an earlier
// draw that gets overwritten by a later one within the same tick is pure
// wasted work, never a second visible frame - the same "multiple renders
// per tick don't produce multiple visible frames" model this whole
// project's other ports already rely on. `mz2ChangeFloor()` just switches
// `mz2CurrentFloor` and calls `mz2InitFloor()` directly.
//
// **A real, faithfully-preserved-not-fixed upstream quirk**: `InitFloor
// ()`'s own per-cell render, for a currently-*invisible* (fogged) maze
// cell, deliberately writes only a 3x3 inner block of blank cells and
// leaves that cell's own top row and left column entirely untouched -
// relying on either a neighboring *visible* cell's own already-drawn
// shared edge, or (if surrounded by other invisible cells too) whatever
// was already sitting in `VVramBack` from a *previous* floor's own
// render into that same buffer position (since `VVramBack` is never
// explicitly zeroed between floor entries, only ever selectively
// overwritten). This is a real, if obscure, potential "ghost fragment
// from a previous floor" artifact that exists on real hardware exactly
// as shipped - not something this port adds or needs to fix, since
// `mz2VVramBack` starts genuinely zero-initialized (`Char_Space`) the
// same way real BSS memory does, matching the very first floor's own
// correct appearance, and any later-floor artifact would be an
// inherited-from-upstream oddity rather than a porting defect.
//
// **Lives-remaining display, a small deliberate improvement over
// Cracky's own equivalent rather than a literal copy of it**: upstream
// draws a real 2x2 `Char_Remain` (`Char_Man`) icon per remaining life
// via `Put2C()`, falling back to an icon+space+digit summary once more
// than 2 lives remain - simplified here, like Cracky's own precedent, to
// plain ascii-text digits instead of baking a decorative icon (matching
// this port's own status-text-only design). Cracky's own equivalent
// simplification left its *common* case (<=2 remaining lives, the only
// case ever actually reachable given `RemainCount` starts at 3 and only
// decreases) rendering nothing but blank spaces - `mz2PrintStatus()`
// instead always shows the real remaining-life count as a single digit
// in both branches, a small, self-consistent, deliberate improvement
// over reproducing what reads as a likely oversight in the sibling port.
//
// **A proactive fix applied from the start, matching an already-found
// sibling bug rather than waiting for a fresh report**: upstream's own
// `Title()` calls `PrintStatus()` directly (showing whatever `Score`/
// `CurrentStage`/`RemainCount`/`StageTime` the *previous* game session
// left behind, since `Main()` only resets `Score`/`CurrentStage`/
// `RemainCount` *after* `Title()` already returns) - the exact same
// shape Cracky's own session found and fixed as a real, live-reported
// bug ("on game over, the time value remains visible on titlescreen").
// `mz2BeginTitle()` resets `mz2StageTime = 0` before calling
// `mz2PrintStatus()`, matching Cracky's own already-user-approved fix,
// applied here proactively rather than needing its own separate report.
//
// **A full re-verification pass, done after this file was first ported and
// only test-compiled (never played) as part of a large parallel batch** -
// specifically targeting the deferred `mz2FloorChangePending`/
// `mz2PendingFloor` mechanism flagged as this port's own highest-risk spot
// (a fix already applied once, during central registration, since
// `mz2ChangeFloor()`/`mz2InitFloor()` are defined later in the file than
// `mz2MoveMan()` and this dialect has no forward declarations). Traced the
// real upstream per-tick sequencing by hand: `MoveMan()` calls
// `ChangeFloor()` *synchronously*, as the very last statement it ever
// executes (nothing in `MoveMan()` runs after the switch that detects a
// stair), and the very next statement in upstream's own outer loop is
// `MoveMonsters()` - so by construction, upstream's own "floor already
// changed before Monsters/Knives/DrawAll see it" behavior only depends on
// the call happening *before* those siblings, not on it happening
// synchronously *inside* `MoveMan()` specifically. The port's own
// `mz2UpdatePlaying()` applies the deferred change immediately after
// `mz2MoveMan()` returns and strictly before `mz2MoveMonsters()`/
// `mz2UpdatePoints()`/the knife-move loop/`mz2DrawAll()` - reproducing the
// exact same "already on the new floor" visibility for every one of those
// siblings, confirmed line-by-line correct rather than assumed.
//
// Every other rendering/state-machine function in this file was also
// re-traced line-by-line against the real upstream source (Main.cpp,
// Man.cpp, Movable.cpp, Monster.cpp, Knife.cpp, Point.cpp, Sprite.cpp,
// VVram.cpp, Vram.cpp, Stage.cpp, Status.cpp/`Title()`, Print.cpp,
// Sound.cpp) - including a full manual derivation of `VVramToVram()`'s
// real 4-physical-columns-per-VVram-cell-pair byte layout (confirmed
// `mz2ComposeMapByte()` reproduces it exactly, sub-case by sub-case) and a
// manual re-trace of `InitFloor()`'s own cursor-walk map-render algorithm
// (confirmed the "3 net columns/rows per cell, walls shared with the
// neighbor" arithmetic nets out identically in both versions). Every data
// table (`AsciiPattern`, `CharPattern`, `Frequencies`, every stage/floor/
// stair/monster/knife array, every melody table, `TitleBytes`) was
// independently re-extracted from the real upstream source via a fresh
// Python script and byte-diffed against this file's own tables - all
// matched exactly, zero transcription errors found. Grepped upstream for
// every non-const global/static declaration with an inline initializer
// (the "Tiny Gilbert `visible=1`"-class bug this project has been bitten
// by before) - none exist in this codebase at all, confirmed via a clean
// project-wide grep, so there was nothing of that shape to miss.
//
// **Live-played via an isolated Puppeteer/WebGL test instance** (its own
// dedicated HTTP server/port, kept separate from any other concurrently-
// running verification session) - confirmed correct rendering across the
// title screen, active gameplay, and, most importantly, **both directions
// of a real floor change**: a temporary debug build (a relocated start
// position one cell from a real down-staircase, an on-screen `mz2Man.x`/
// `.y`/direction/input readout, and a temporary monster-collision bypass
// - all fully reverted before this file shipped, confirmed via a clean
// grep) walked onto the stair and confirmed the map/monster layout fully
// rebuilt to floor 1's own distinct pattern, then walked back onto the
// same cell (now floor 1's own up-stair) and confirmed it correctly
// rebuilt back to floor 0's original layout - both transitions render
// cleanly with no corruption, crash, or stale/mismatched data. Normal
// (non-debug) play was also confirmed separately: movement, wall
// collision (correctly blocked at real maze walls in multiple directions,
// matching a hand-decoded reference maze layout), and a real, unscripted
// monster collision correctly killing Man and triggering the death
// animation -> retry sequence (`mz2BeginLose()`/`mz2UpdateLoseAnim()`/
// `mz2InitTrying()`), all observed working correctly during ordinary
// navigation attempts (not just the temporary god-mode build).
//
// **A real, generalizable testing-environment pitfall hit twice during
// this pass, worth remembering for any future isolated-Puppeteer
// verification session**: a screen that looked like genuine data
// corruption (scattered/garbled glyphs in place of the checkered maze,
// or repeating text-like glyphs tiled across the whole map) appeared
// twice, and **neither instance was a real bug in this file** - both
// traced back to the test harness's own isolated HTTP server, not the
// game. The first instance was a genuine port collision: multiple
// `python -m http.server` processes ended up bound to the same port
// simultaneously (confirmed via `netstat`), so requests were being
// served inconsistently between two different ROMs/sessions. The second
// was a stale/cached response from an HTTP server process that had
// otherwise correctly restarted, serving an old `Content-Length` for
// several consecutive requests despite the on-disk file already being
// current (confirmed by writing a fresh marker file into the served
// directory and checking a brand-new port could see it immediately,
// while the old port still could not) - a plain server restart on the
// same port was not sufficient to clear it, a fresh port was. Before
// trusting any screenshot that looks like real corruption, verify the
// serving setup itself first (a single confirmed `netstat` listener, and
// a `Content-Length`/file-size match against the actual on-disk ROM) -
// re-deriving a whole bug theory (as this session initially did, before
// catching the actual cause) from a test-harness artifact wastes far
// more time than a 10-second server sanity check up front.
//
// **No real bugs were found in this file's own game logic or rendering
// during this entire re-verification pass** - every area flagged as
// higher-risk (the deferred floor-change mechanism specifically) checked
// out correct both by exhaustive static tracing against upstream and by
// live play exercising it in both directions. Not independently
// re-verified this session: the second stage-0 staircase at maze
// position (3,4) (confirmed via a full BFS reachability scan of floor 0's
// own real corridor graph to be genuinely unreachable from the stage's
// own start position through normal movement - not investigated further,
// since it's upstream's own maze data determining this, not a porting
// choice), reaching the real goal cell (`mz2Reached`/`mz2BeginClearWait`/
// the bonus-tally sequence), and stages beyond stage 0 - all reuse the
// exact same, already-verified `mz2InitFloor()`/`mz2ChangeFloor()`/
// `mz2UpdatePlaying()` machinery with different data, so risk is low, but
// worth a direct check if anything is ever reported off.
//
// **Explicitly cross-checked against the title-screen text-width bug found
// later via a real user-supplied Cracky hardware photo** (see CLAUDE.md's
// own "A real user-supplied hardware photo overturns Cracky's own title-
// screen design" section, and `gameCracky.c`'s own header comment for the
// full story) - that bug was every sibling Cate-engine port having copied
// Cracky's *original*, wrong `crkStatusChar[8][8]`-style narrow status-only
// grid and then also routed title-screen text through it, causing "MINI"/
// the credit line to be dropped and "CONTINUE" to overflow/truncate. This
// file was never affected: `mz2StatusChar` was already built as a genuine
// `[8][32]` whole-screen-width grid from this port's very first version
// (see the "Status/UI text lives in ONE unified whole-screen overlay grid"
// section above, written before Cracky's own bug was ever found) - a
// design that happens to already be architecturally equivalent to Cracky's
// own *fixed* version, not the narrow one every other sibling had to be
// corrected away from. Re-verified directly against upstream's real
// `Status.cpp` (`Title()`/`PrintStatus()`/`PrintScore()`/`PrintTime()`)
// column-by-column - `mz2BeginTitle()` already places "MINI" at its real
// computed column, "START"/full "CONTINUE" (all 8 letters) at column 9,
// and the "INUFUTO 2026" credit line at column 12, all correctly clear of
// the SCORE/STAGE/TIME/lives status labels' own `MZ2_LEFT_X`(24)-based
// columns - matching Cracky's own now-fixed reference implementation
// exactly, with nothing to change. Confirmed live via an isolated
// Puppeteer/WebGL instance: the title screen renders "MAZY2"/"MINI"/
// "SCORE 00"/"STAGE 1"/"▶START"/"CONTINUE"(full word, un-truncated)/
// "TIME 0"/"INUFUTO 2026" all simultaneously, fully legible, with no
// dropped or overlapping text - including a genuine, faithfully-preserved
// upstream quirk this test incidentally re-confirmed: a "2" (RemainCount-1)
// digit visibly rendered next to the credit line, because upstream's own
// `Main()` sets `RemainCount = 3` *before* ever calling `Title()` for the
// first time (line 36 of `Main.cpp`, ahead of the `title:` label at line
// 40) - so real hardware genuinely shows the lives-remaining count on the
// title screen too, not a bug.
