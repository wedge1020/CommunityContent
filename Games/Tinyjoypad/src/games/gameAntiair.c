// AntiAir mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306+CH32V003 "Cate engine" edition,
// license "None specified" - GitHub reports no LICENSE file for
// `UIAPduino_antiair`, same author/situation as this project's own already-
// shipped CRACKY mini) - a fixed-position shooter: shift a cannon left/right
// along the ground, shoot upward to destroy a small grid of UFOs before their
// falling bombs/blocks bury you. Blocks that fall to the ground stack up and
// can block the cannon's own movement; bombs explode into a "bang" that also
// destroys any block piled at that spot. Clearing every UFO in the current
// wave (after a short pause) reveals a fresh wave on the SAME life, cycling
// through 10 hand-authored wave layouts forever; 3 lives, no persisted
// hi-score (upstream has none at all - confirmed by grep, unlike CRACKY).
//
// Picked as the next Cate-engine port after CRACKY, following that file's own
// architecture directly: `Movable`/`VVram`/`Vram`/nibble-packed `CharPattern`
// glyphs are all the exact same shapes as CRACKY's own (same author, same
// shared display/print plumbing), and - just like CRACKY - **no display-
// orientation transform of any kind is used**: `aarComposeRawByte()` is drawn
// directly at its own (col,page) via `md_drawColumn()`, matching CRACKY's own
// hard-won conclusion (see that file's own header) that the two SSD1306
// hardware remap commands some UIAPduino modules issue exist to compensate
// for a physical panel-mounting quirk with no equivalent to correct for in a
// software recreation.
//
// **A genuine, real circular function-call dependency between 3 modules**
// (Cannon needs Bullet's `CanFire()`/`StartBullet()`; Bullet needs Ufo's
// `HitUfo()` and Block's `HitBlock()`; Block needs Cannon's `HitCannon()`) -
// resolved upstream via separate translation units + header declarations,
// which this dialect's single-pass, top-to-bottom file has no direct
// equivalent for. Broken with the minimum number of real forward
// declarations needed (4: `aarCanFire`/`aarStartBullet` ahead of the Cannon
// section, `aarHitUfo`/`aarHitBlock` ahead of the Bullet section) - matching
// this project's own established precedent that plain forward declarations
// ARE supported by this dialect (confirmed already working in
// `gameTinyPipe.c`'s own `tpipeRunR`/`tpipeRunL`), used here specifically
// because physical reordering alone cannot resolve a genuine 3-way cycle.
// `aarGround[]` (Block's own ground-occupancy array, needed by Cannon's
// `CanMove()`) is declared early as shared global data instead, alongside
// `aarCannon`/`aarCannonLive` (needed by Bullet's `StartBullet()`) - a
// data-only dependency needs no forward declaration at all, just an early
// declaration site.
//
// **VVram/Vram plumbing is structurally identical to CRACKY's own** (same
// `VVramWidth=24`/`VVramHeight=16` grid, same `CharPatternSize=2`-bytes/glyph
// nibble-interleaved packing via `SendUL()`, same `LeftX=24`-cell-offset
// 8-char status column at raw columns 96-127) - reused `crkComposeRawByte()`'s
// exact sub-column math (renamed `aarGlyphSubByte()`, factored into a small
// shared helper since this port also needs the identical math for the "2x2
// icon printed inline with text" case below, not duplicated per Cracky's own
// slightly more repetitive inline version). One real difference from CRACKY:
// AntiAir's own `VVram[]` is declared upstream as a genuine flat 1D byte
// array (`byte VVram[VVramWidth*VVramHeight]`), not row/column 2D - and
// `DrawUfos()` walks it with raw pointer arithmetic that can advance a
// pointer *past* one logical VVram row into the next during normal drawing
// (never actually observed to matter given the formation's own bounded
// oscillation range, but a real characteristic of the original code) -
// ported as a flat `int[VVramWidth*VVramHeight] aarVVram` with an explicit
// flat index instead of Cracky's own `int[16][24]` 2D array, to stay
// faithful to that flat-pointer-arithmetic shape rather than force it into a
// 2D model it wasn't written for.
//
// **Status text placement, traced precisely against upstream's own real
// `LeftX=24`/`VramStep=4` addressing** - `aarStatusChar`/`aarComposeRawByte()`
// now model upstream's own real, genuinely wide 32-char-cell-per-page Vram
// canvas directly (matching CRACKY's own equivalent, already-corrected fix
// - see that file's own `crkStatusChar`/`crkFullWidthText` header comments
// for the full story of the real user-supplied hardware photo that proved
// an earlier, narrower 8-column model wrong for this whole family). SCORE/
// STAGE labels, the score/stage digit values, and the remain-count icons
// all live at their own real, literal upstream columns (24-31, i.e.
// `LeftX`/`LeftX+2`/`LeftX+6`/`LeftX+1`) - no local-offset remapping needed
// anymore, the array index IS the real column. `PrintGameOver()`'s own raw
// column (`8*VramStep=32`) lands *inside* the map area, not the status
// column - the same "message burned directly over the map, relying on real
// VRAM persistence" pattern CRACKY's own `PrintTimeUp`/`PrintGameOver`
// already needed a `crkOverlay*` mechanism for - reused here identically as
// `aarOverlay*`/`aarBeginOverlay`.
//
// **Title() screen text placed at upstream's own real, literal columns**
// (matching CRACKY's own already-corrected fix exactly) - upstream's own
// Title() prints "MINI"/"INUFUTO 2026"/"START"/"CONTINUE" at real columns
// 8-23, genuinely clear of the status labels' own columns 24-31, using the
// exact same shared `PrintC()`/`PrintS()` mechanism the status labels use,
// just at different column arguments - not a separate, narrower canvas at
// all. `aarFullWidthText` (see its own header comment) is what lets
// `aarComposeRawByte()` actually reach those columns instead of being
// artificially confined to the narrow status zone. AntiAir's real title
// ("ANTIAIR") is fully spellable in this game's own 26-glyph font (space,
// digits, '>', A C E F G I M N O R S T U V), and so is the real author
// credit "INUFUTO 2026" in full (both the space and every digit are in that
// same glyph set) - unlike CRACKY, which genuinely needed character
// substitution for its own game name/credit to fit the available glyphs.
// Upstream's own real 5-block bitmap logo is simplified to plain text via
// the same status-text machinery, matching CRACKY's own established
// precedent for that game's own bitmap logo - see `aarBeginTitle()`'s own
// header comment for the exact column placements and the two-round bug
// history (a first, wrong "narrow 8-column grid" model, then this fix).
//
// **The "remain count" lives indicator uses `Put2C()` upstream - a genuine
// 2x2-icon-glyph inline print (not a plain ASCII character)**, traced
// through by hand: it interleaves 4 consecutive `CharPattern` glyph indices
// (c, c+1, c+2, c+3 - the exact same 2x2-composited-sprite convention
// `aarShowSprite()`'s own `AarSprite` compositing uses) into 8 real output
// columns via the identical nibble-pack math as every other glyph draw in
// this engine. Reproduced with a small dedicated dispatch inside
// `aarComposeRawByte()`'s own status-column branch (gated to the exact
// column range `Put2C()` would occupy, using `aarGlyphSubByte()`) rather
// than inventing a general "icon overlay" system for what upstream only
// ever uses in this one place. `RemainCount` only ever starts at 3 and
// decrements (confirmed via a full-project grep - nothing ever increments
// it), so upstream's own `i>2` digit-mode branch (a fallback for 4+ lives)
// is genuinely unreachable dead code here - not ported, noted instead.
//
// **Sound**: the exact same real 3-tone-channel tracker as CRACKY's own
// `Sound.cpp` (same `ToneChannel`/`EffectChannel` classes, same
// `SoundHandler()` structure, same real 60Hz `SysTick`-driven call rate -
// confirmed directly via this game's own `Timer.cpp`, `kTimerHz=60`) - only
// `Tempo` differs (200 here vs CRACKY's 160), giving a different real note-
// duration formula: a channel advances once every `(600/2)/200 = 1.5` real
// 60Hz ticks (vs CRACKY's own 1.875), so `aarNoteFrames(length) = round(
// length * 1.5)`. `Sound_Fire()` (a short one-shot melody, channel 0) and
// `Sound_Start()`/`Sound_GameOver()`/`StartBGM()` (channels 1/2, the latter
// two originally blocking `WaitMelody()` calls converted to explicit
// AAR_STATE_START_JINGLE/GAMEOVER_JINGLE frame-stepped waits, the same
// treatment CRACKY's own CRK_STATE_START_JINGLE/GAMEOVER_JINGLE needed) all
// route through the same `aarStartSeq`/`aarAdvanceOneSeq` 3-slot sequencer
// CRACKY established, advanced every real engine frame independent of
// `AAR_TICK_DIVISOR` - matching upstream's own real SysTick-ISR-independent-
// of-the-main-loop's-`WaitTimer()` structure. `Sound_SmallBang()`/
// `Sound_LargeBang()` are a *different* upstream sound source entirely - a
// genuine white-noise `EffectChannel`, not a `ToneChannel` melody - with no
// equivalent primitive in this project's own `md_playTone()` model;
// approximated as a short, one-shot plain tone at the same nominal
// frequency (3000Hz small bang / 1500Hz large bang) called directly
// (bypassing the 3-slot sequencer entirely, since `md_playTone()` is itself
// already genuinely multi-voice - see this project's own CLAUDE.md write-up
// on that fix - so a direct call here can't collide with a concurrently
// sequenced melody note any more than upstream's own separate Effect
// channel could collide with its own ToneChannels).
//
// **Main.cpp's own real per-tick sub-throttling, ported literally rather
// than collapsed**: the main loop's own `Clock` byte (incrementing once per
// `WaitTimer(3)` cycle = once per `AAR_TICK_DIVISOR`-gated logic tick, i.e.
// a genuine 60/3=20Hz rate) gates `MoveFighter()`/`MoveBlocks()`/
// `UpdateBangs()` to every OTHER logic tick (`Clock&1==0`, ~10Hz) and
// `MoveUfos()` to every 8th (`Clock&7==0`, 2.5Hz), while `MoveBullets()`/
// `UpdateBlocks()`/the redraw run every logic tick (20Hz) - ported as one
// flat `aarClock` counter with the identical bitmask gates, rather than
// trying to further decompose this into separate states the way CRACKY's
// own more elaborate blocking-animation-heavy loop needed; AntiAir's own
// loop has only 2 genuinely blocking calls (`Sound_Start`/`Sound_GameOver`),
// both already covered by the jingle states above.
//
// **A shared `linger` byte with two entirely independent purposes,
// preserved exactly as one shared counter rather than split into two**:
// upstream increments the SAME local `linger` in two separate, non-
// exclusive `if` blocks each real tick (once if `UfoCount==0`, again -
// genuinely a *second* increment on the same tick - if `!CannonLive`, since
// both conditions really can be true simultaneously) - ported as one
// persistent `aarLinger` global with the identical two independent `if`
// blocks, not merged into an `else if`, since a literal replication of this
// double-increment quirk (whatever perceptible effect it has, likely none
// in practice) costs nothing extra to preserve faithfully. Clearing every
// UFO in a wave (`aarLinger>31`, matching upstream's own `250*CoordRate/8`)
// advances `aarCurrentStage` and reloads a fresh wave via `aarInitStage()`
// *without* leaving `AAR_STATE_PLAYING` at all - cannon/bullets/blocks/bangs
// all persist untouched across the transition, exactly matching upstream's
// real "seamless wave-to-wave" structure (no `goto try_`, no jingle). Losing
// the cannon (`aarLinger>25`, matching `200*CoordRate/8`) either restarts
// the current life via `aarBeginTry()` (which, matching `InitPlaying()`
// exactly, resets bullets/cannon/blocks/bangs and calls the FULL
// `aarResetUfos()` - reloading direction/sweep-position but deliberately
// *not* `aarInitUfos()`, so any UFOs already destroyed in the current wave
// stay destroyed across a life loss - a genuine, deliberate upstream design
// choice, not an oversight) or ends the game (`AAR_STATE_GAMEOVER_JINGLE`,
// `RemainCount==0`).
//
// **A genuine AVR/CH32-implicit-byte-wraparound-reliance audit, the same
// bug family this whole project has documented repeatedly** (byte
// truncation/shift wraparound/signed sentinels/rand()-range mismatches/
// logical-vs-arithmetic shifts - see this project's own CLAUDE.md) - found
// and explicitly masked with `& 0xFF` at every site actually load-bearing:
// (1) `Bullet.y` (`byte`) is decremented toward 0 and relies on wrapping to
// 0xFF (255) to trigger its own `y >= Range` removal check once it goes
// negative - without an explicit mask after `--`, this port's own
// non-wrapping `int` would instead go permanently negative, silently
// stranding that bullet slot forever (confirmed by tracing: `CoordMask=0`
// here means the "sub-pixel aligned" gate `(y & CoordMask)==0` is
// unconditionally true, so `Hit()` would still fire on a negative y every
// tick with no meaningful geometry match - the bullet just never frees
// its own slot). (2) `UfoRowCenterX` and its own derived `center`/`x`
// values in `MoveUfos()`/`DrawUfos()`/`HitUfo()` are *designed* to swing
// slightly negative (the formation's own left-bounce math) and rely on byte
// wraparound to stay a small, consistently-representable value either way -
// masked at each assignment, reproducing upstream's own literal
// `static_cast<byte>(...)` casts exactly (confirmed via a script-verified
// derivation that masking at each step reproduces the same true modular
// value the real hardware byte would hold, not just "doesn't crash").
// (3) `Bang::Start()`'s own `x - Size*2`/`y - Size*2` offsets (used for the
// "large bang" 4-piece explosion) can genuinely go negative when the
// cannon/a bomb is destroyed right at the left edge (`x=0`) - masked at the
// single shared `aarBangStartOne()` entry point both `aarStartSmallBang`/
// `aarStartLargeBang` funnel through, so a wrapped value correctly fails
// the existing `x >= AAR_BANG_RANGE_X` off-screen check instead of
// underflowing into a genuine negative array-adjacent write.
// `Ground[]`/`Sprite[]`/`FallingBlock[]` array-neighbor accesses that
// upstream itself leaves entirely unguarded (`pGround[-1]`/`pGround[1]`/
// etc, harmless-on-real-flat-AVR/RISC-V-memory but a genuine out-of-bounds
// read/write risk here) were given the same kind of defensive bounds guard
// this project has added at equivalent sites elsewhere (e.g. Tiny Arena's
// own `Lvl1` fix) - `aarMakeBang()`/`aarMoveBlocks()`/`aarUpdateBlocks()`
// each gate their own `[x-1]`/`[x+1]`-style neighbor lookups against the
// real `0..AAR_WINDOW_WIDTH-1` array bounds before touching them.
//
// **`RndIndex`/`Numbers[32]` (Math.cpp) is byte-identical to CRACKY's own
// `crkRndNumbers[]`** (same author, same shared utility table) - ported the
// same way, a fixed pre-shuffled cycle through 0-31 (reset to index 0 at
// the start of every life via `aarBeginTry()`, matching upstream's own
// `InitPlaying()`), **not** routed through this project's own shared
// `arand()` helper the way most other ports' *real* `rand()`/`random()`
// calls are - this game (like CRACKY) never calls a real RNG at all,
// deterministic-by-design. One difference from CRACKY's own `crkRnd()`:
// this game's `Rnd()` returns the *full* 0-31 value (no `&0x0f` mask),
// confirmed directly against the real `Math.cpp` source.
//
// Dead/unused upstream code, confirmed via grep before being dropped rather
// than guessed: `Movable.h`'s own `LocateMovable`/`IsNear`/`IsOnCellGrid`/
// `IsOnCoordGrid` (declared, never defined or called anywhere in this game -
// this game's own `Movable` struct doesn't even carry the `dx`/`dy` fields
// those functions would need) and its `MapShift`/`MapRate`/`MapMask`
// constants (declared, never referenced); `Ufo.cpp`'s own `RowHeight`
// constant (declared, but every real use of "3 VVram rows per UFO row" in
// the file uses a bare literal `3` instead of the constant); `Bang.h`'s own
// `StartBang()` (declared, never defined - only `StartSmallBang`/
// `StartLargeBang` exist); `Print.cpp`'s own `PrintByteNumber3` (defined,
// never called - `PrintByteNumber2` is the only one AntiAir's own
// `Status.cpp` actually uses).
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   Post-ship verification pass (this port was only test-compiled, never
//   played, when first written - this pass actually launched and played it
//   via Puppeteer against the real WebGL build, on top of a full line-by-line
//   re-read of every real upstream .h/.cpp file and a script-verified byte
//   diff of every data table - AsciiPattern/CharPattern/Frequencies/all 5
//   sound melodies/the 10 Stages rows all matched upstream exactly, no
//   transcription errors found there).
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// **Two real, empirically-confirmed rendering bugs, both self-inflicted by
// this port's own title-screen text layout, neither present upstream** -
// found via an actual Puppeteer screenshot of the title screen (not caught
// by static review beforehand), which showed "ANTIAIRO" where the score
// should have been and a stray "E" bleeding onto the remain-icon row:
//
// 1. **`aarBeginTitle()` put "ANTIAIR" on page 1** - but `aarPrintStatus()`
//    (called immediately before it) ALSO writes to page 1 (the SCORE
//    *value* digits, via `aarPrintScore()`/`aarPrintNumber5()`, cols 2-7).
//    This file's own original header comment claimed the title text was
//    "deliberately placed on pages not already used by aarPrintStatus()
//    (0/3/7)" - that list was wrong/incomplete: it only accounted for the
//    two *label* pages (0/3) and the remain-icon page (7), missing that
//    page 1 is genuinely used too (the score value, not a label). The
//    title text silently clobbered the score digits, visibly confirmed on
//    screen as "ANTIAIRO" (7 letters overwriting cols 0-6, leaving only
//    the score's own trailing literal '0' surviving at col 7). This has
//    no equivalent upstream at all - the real `Title()` draws its own
//    logo bitmap in the *map area* (a totally disjoint region from the
//    status column the score lives in), so upstream could never have this
//    collision; it's purely an artifact of this port's own status-column-
//    text simplification of that logo. **Fixed** by moving "ANTIAIR" onto
//    page 2 (a page genuinely never touched by `aarPrintStatus()`) and
//    dropping the separate "MINI" subtitle line entirely - the one piece
//    of this screen's text that isn't functionally essential (the game
//    name, the credit, and the two real menu options all are) - to free up
//    exactly enough genuinely-unused pages (2/4/5/6) for the 4 lines that
//    remain, with none colliding with `aarPrintStatus()`'s own pages
//    (0/1/3/7).
// 2. **"CONTINUE" (8 characters) started at col 1** (leaving col 0 free for
//    the '>' selection cursor, matching "START"'s own layout), needing
//    cols 1-8 - but `aarStatusChar` is only 8 columns wide (valid indices
//    0-7 only). The 8th character silently overflowed past the array's own
//    row, landing in `aarStatusChar[7][0]` via the flat `[8][8]` row-major
//    layout (`[6][8]` and `[7][0]` are the same underlying memory) -
//    visibly confirmed on screen as a stray "E" (the last letter of
//    "CONTINUE") bleeding onto the remain-count-icon row. **Fixed** by
//    shortening the label to "CONTINU" (7 characters, fitting cols 1-7
//    exactly) - `aarPrintC()` also gained its own defensive bounds guard
//    (`col >= 0 && col < 8`) as a second, general-purpose layer of
//    protection against this exact overflow shape recurring anywhere else
//    in this file, matching this project's own standing "guard an out-of-
//    bounds write even after fixing its one known root cause" practice.
//
// Both fixes were verified via a real Puppeteer screenshot of the rebuilt
// title screen: "SCORE"/"    00", "ANTIAIR", "STAGE  1", "INUFUTO",
// "START"/"CONTINU", and the 2 remain-count icons all now render cleanly on
// their own distinct pages with zero cross-contamination.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   Later correction: the two "fixes" directly above were symptom-patches
//   for the wrong diagnosis, not the real root cause
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// **A real user-supplied hardware photo of the sibling CRACKY port's own
// title screen** (see that file's own `crkStatusChar`/`crkFullWidthText`
// header comments) proved the whole premise behind bugs 1 and 2 above was
// wrong: `aarStatusChar` was modeled as an 8-column-wide grid representing
// ONLY the narrow status zone (upstream's own real columns 24-31), and
// title-screen text was being crammed into that same narrow grid - which is
// why it collided with SCORE's own digits (bug 1) and why "CONTINUE"
// overflowed past 8 columns (bug 2). Re-reading upstream's real `Status.cpp`
// (`Title()`) line by line shows none of that text ever collides with
// anything on real hardware, because upstream's own Vram address space is a
// genuinely wide 32-char-cell-per-page canvas - the status labels really are
// confined to columns 24-31, but every piece of title-screen text sits at
// columns 8-23, a completely different part of the same page. **Fixed
// properly** by widening `aarStatusChar` to `[8][32]` (matching real upstream
// column indices directly, no more implicit "+24" local-offset baked into a
// narrow array) and adding `aarFullWidthText` (true only in AAR_STATE_TITLE)
// so `aarComposeRawByte()` reads the full 32-column range during the title
// screen instead of just the narrow status zone - the same fix shape CRACKY
// already received. This let "MINI" and the full "INUFUTO 2026" credit (both
// previously dropped, believing there was no room) be restored, and
// "CONTINUE" be shown in full (previously truncated to "CONTINU") - all
// placed at upstream's own real, literal columns (see `aarBeginTitle()`'s
// own header comment for the exact list) rather than needing any trimming/
// relocating/dropping at all. `aarPrintScore()`/`aarPrintStage()`/
// `aarPrintStatus()` were updated to use the real absolute upstream columns
// (26/31/30/24) instead of the old local 0-7 offsets, and the remain-count
// icon dispatch inside `aarComposeRawByte()` was updated to match (absolute
// raw column 100 instead of a relative "`- 96`, then `- 4`" offset chain).
// Verified via a live Puppeteer screenshot of the rebuilt title screen: every
// line ("SCORE"/digits, "ANTIAIR", "STAGE"/digits, "MINI", "INUFUTO 2026" in
// full, "START"/"CONTINUE" in full with the cursor at its own real column,
// and the remain-count icons) renders correctly on its own real page/column
// with zero cross-contamination, and normal gameplay (status labels/values
// during AAR_STATE_PLAYING, which never sets `aarFullWidthText`) is
// unaffected.
//
// **A minor, real-but-low-impact `Clock`/`linger` timing fidelity gap**,
// found via line-by-line comparison against `Main.cpp`'s own real
// goto-chain (not visible in play - only affects which exact real frame
// the `Clock&1`/`Clock&7` sub-throttles land on, never *whether*/*when* a
// wave-clear or life-loss actually fires, since those are driven by
// `linger`, which was already correctly scoped): upstream's own `Clock`
// is reset to 0 only once, right after `Title()` returns (a genuinely
// fresh match), and deliberately keeps running across every `goto try_`
// life retry within that same match. This port's `aarClock` was being
// reset to 0 inside `aarBeginTry()` itself - called on *both* a fresh
// match *and* every life retry - so a retry's own Clock phase didn't match
// upstream's. **Fixed** by moving the reset to `aarUpdateTitle()`'s
// `justFire` branch (matching "right after Title() returns" exactly) and
// removing it from `aarBeginTry()`.
//
// **A minor audio-fidelity gap in `aarStopBgm()`**: upstream's own
// `StopBGM()` resets ALL 3 real `ToneChannels` (`for (auto& channel :
// ToneChannels) channel.Reset();`), not just the 2 BGM voices - including
// channel 0, the one-shot Fire SFX. The port's `aarStopBgm()` only stopped
// channels 1/2, so a Fire jingle that happened to still be mid-playback
// the exact instant the cannon died could keep advancing/re-triggering
// `md_playTone()` afterward instead of being cut off immediately.
// **Fixed** by also calling `aarStopSeq(0)`.
//
// **Extensive re-verification of everything else found no further bugs**:
// every draw/compositing function (`aarComposeRawByte`/`aarGlyphSubByte`/
// `aarDrawSprites`/`aarDrawBackground`/`aarDrawUfos`, including the
// Put2C()-style remain-icon dispatch) was traced byte-for-byte against its
// real upstream counterpart and confirmed to match exactly, including the
// subtle nibble-pack column math and the DrawUfos()/DrawSprites() pointer-
// arithmetic sequencing. Every state transition (title -> start jingle ->
// playing -> [stays playing across a wave-clear] -> [retry or game-over-
// jingle on cannon death] -> title) was traced against `Main.cpp`'s own
// real goto-chain and confirmed to match, including every reset/init step
// at each transition and every non-zero upstream global initializer
// (`RemainCount=3`/`CurrentStage=0` at boot, matched). The one genuinely
// "wild" characteristic already flagged in this file's own header comment
// - `DrawUfos()`'s raw flat-index pointer arithmetic with no per-row
// column-wraparound guard - was re-derived algebraically (not just
// asserted) and confirmed the formation's own bounce-boundary math keeps
// every index it touches within the real VVram bounds during normal play;
// a UFO drawn right at the map area's own rightmost edge (column 95,
// immediately adjacent to the status column's column 96 with zero visual
// gap) was directly observed via a zoomed screenshot crop and confirmed
// to stop exactly at the boundary with no actual overlap/corruption.
//
// **Empirically exercised via Puppeteer against the real WebGL build**
// (not just compiled): the title/attract screen (including the cursor
// toggle between START/CONTINUE), a fresh game start through the real
// ~3.6s start jingle into active gameplay, cannon movement in both
// directions, firing and killing multiple real UFOs across several
// stages (score climbing correctly, e.g. 0->160->220->380->440),
// falling blocks landing on the ground and rendering the block/bang
// sprites correctly, a real cannon death and automatic life-loss retry
// (remain-icon count correctly stepping 3->2->1, the SAME wave's already-
// destroyed UFOs staying destroyed across the retry, matching upstream's
// documented `aarResetUfos()`-not-`aarInitUfos()` design), and - via a
// temporary debug hook (forcing `aarUfoCount=0`/`aarCannonLive=false`/
// `aarRemainCount=1` and a lowered `aarLinger` threshold, all fully
// reverted afterward, confirmed via a project-wide grep for "TEMP DEBUG"
// returning zero matches before the final rebuild) - both a genuine
// wave-clear transition (STAGE digit visibly advancing from "1" to "2",
// a fresh 6-UFO wave 2 layout correctly replacing the cleared 5-UFO
// wave 1 layout) and a genuine game-over sequence (the "GAME OVER"
// overlay rendering cleanly over the frozen final gameplay frame, then
// correctly returning to a title screen showing zero remain-count icons)
// were directly observed and confirmed correct.
