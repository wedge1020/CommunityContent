// NEURAS mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, license "None specified" -
// GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_neuras`, same author/hardware/
// engine lineage as this project's own already-shipped Cracky port) - pick up
// and throw numbered cards, lining up two (or more) cards sharing the same
// number in a row/column to clear them; clear every card on a 32x16-cell
// stage to advance, across 8 hand-authored stages, while dodging a small
// chasing-monster roster, with a real countdown clock and 3 lives.
//
// Ported directly following `gameCracky.c`'s own already-proven structural
// patterns (same "Cate engine": `VVram`/`Vram`/`Chars`/`Sound`/`Timer`/`Oled`
// files are close cousins of Cracky's own, several data tables - the shared
// `logo`+`wall` glyph rows in `CharPattern`, the identical 27-character
// `AsciiPattern` table - are byte-identical between the two games) - see that
// file's own header comment for the shim/rendering architecture this port
// reuses wholesale. Only 4 directions + 1 action button
// (`isLeftPressed()`/`isRightPressed()`/`isUpPressed()`/`isDownPressed()`/
// `isFirePressed()`), no new shim primitive needed - `isFire2Pressed()` goes
// unused here too, matching Cracky.
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform is needed here either** -
// confirmed directly from `Oled.h`'s own `SegRemap`/`ComScanDec` command
// values, identical to Cracky's own already-settled (after a real, painful,
// user-reported debugging saga - see that file's own header) conclusion:
// these two real-hardware panel-mounting-correction commands have no
// equivalent thing to correct for in a software recreation. `neuComposeRawByte
// (col,page)` is drawn directly at its own `(col,page)` via `md_drawColumn()`
// - no column mirror, no page reorder, no bit-reversal.
//
// **Rendering is the same two-level tile system as Cracky, ported the same
// way**: `VVram` is a 24x16 logical glyph-index grid (`neuVVram`);
// `VVramToVram()`'s own `SendUL()` nibble-interleaving is reproduced exactly
// in `neuComposeRawByte()`/`neuIconByte()`. Unlike Cracky (which keeps a
// separate persistent `VVramBack`/`VVramFront` pair plus a dirty-tracking
// `Backup[]` purely as a real-I2C-bandwidth optimization with no analogue
// here), this port rebuilds the *entire* `neuVVram` grid fresh every single
// frame from three layers (walls, floor cards, sprites) via `neuDrawAll()`,
// matching this project's own standing "always redraw the full frame, don't
// replicate a VRAM-persistence-reliant partial-redraw trick" precedent -
// the same choice Cracky's own `crkDrawAll()` already made for this exact
// engine.
//
// **A genuinely new rendering wrinkle beyond what Cracky needed**: two small
// UI elements - the "how many lives remain" icon strip and the "currently
// held card" icon - are drawn via upstream's `Put2C()` (a *direct*-to-
// hardware, VVram-bypassing 2x2-glyph icon blit, distinct from `PrintC()`'s
// plain-ASCII text blit) rather than through the VVram grid at all. Ported
// with a small dedicated `neuIconByte()` helper (an exact re-derivation of
// `Put2C()`'s own nibble math, confirmed by hand-tracing which two glyphs
// -c/c+1 upper, c+2/c+3 lower - contribute to which of the 4 output columns)
// plus two small pieces of state (`neuHeldCardGlyph`, `neuRemainIconCount`)
// that `neuComposeRawByte()` checks before falling back to the plain
// ASCII-text status grid for the rest of the status column - avoids needing
// upstream's own direct-Vram-write model entirely.
//
// **The title-screen logo draws upstream's own real 96-value `TitleBytes`
// bitmap table (`Status.cpp`'s `Title()`), the same fix already applied to
// the sibling game Cracky's own "CRACKY" logo (see that file's own header
// comment and CLAUDE.md's own "A second, related architectural issue"
// writeup for the full story).** An earlier version of this port
// simplified this ornate-but-supposedly-"decorative" pixel-art wordmark
// down to plain small ASCII text - that reasoning was wrong: it's the
// single biggest, most prominent element on the whole title screen, not
// filler. `neuTitleBytes[]` (byte-diff-extracted from the real upstream
// source via a small Python script) is now drawn directly into `neuVVram`
// at its own real position (VVram rows 2-5 / hardware pages 1-2, matching
// upstream's own `VVramFront + VVramWidth*2 + TitleLeft(0)` offset exactly
// - `TitleLeft=0` since the 6-letter "NEURAS" wordmark exactly fills the
// full 24-cell `VVramWidth`), with `neuComposeRawByte()` OR-combining that
// VVram content with the status-grid text layer rather than choosing one
// exclusively - the two occupy disjoint page ranges by construction, so
// they can never actually collide. See `neuBeginTitle()`'s own comment for
// the exact drawing loop. The credit line ("INUFUTO 2026") and "MINI" are
// both drawn at upstream's own real, literal columns too, once
// `neuStatusChar` was widened from an original, wrong 8-column grid to the
// real 32-column-per-page canvas upstream actually has (see that global's
// own header comment) - nothing needs shortening or dropping anymore.
//
// **The GAME OVER / TIME UP messages reuse Cracky's own overlay mechanism
// exactly** (`neuOverlayActive`/`neuOverlayText`/`neuOverlayLen`/
// `neuOverlayPage`/`neuOverlayCol`, checked by `neuRender()` before falling
// back to `neuComposeRawByte()`) - both messages are, in real upstream too,
// drawn directly into the *map* area (not the status area) via `PrintS()`
// calls that bypass VVram, so this is the same "persists on real hardware
// with nothing else re-touching those exact bytes" situation Cracky's own
// header comment already documents and solves the same way.
//
// **The blocking upstream control flow (Main.cpp's own goto-chained
// `title:`/`try_:`/`lose:` labels around one big `while(true)`+`do..while`,
// plus several real `WaitMelody()`/`WaitTimer()` blocking waits scattered
// through `Sound.cpp`/`Card.cpp`) is rewritten as an explicit frame-stepped
// state machine**, the usual treatment every port in this project needs:
// NEU_STATE_TITLE (`Title()`'s own key-poll loop), NEU_STATE_START_JINGLE
// (the blocking `Sound_Start()` held before play begins - and again once a
// stage's own bonus tally finishes, matching upstream's *identical* `try_:`
// entry sequence being reached from three different places: a fresh game, a
// life-lost retry, and stage advance), NEU_STATE_PLAYING (the main
// tick-gated loop), NEU_STATE_MATCH_REVEAL (see below), NEU_STATE_DIE_ANIM
// (`EndSolver()`'s own 20-step blink-and-beep loop, monster-collision death
// only), NEU_STATE_TIMEUP_SWEEP (the real `repeat(15){Sound_Loose();}` after
// a countdown reaches 0 - time-up death has *no* visible blink animation of
// its own, unlike a monster-collision death, matching upstream exactly),
// NEU_STATE_GAMEOVER_JINGLE, NEU_STATE_CLEAR_JINGLE (`Sound_Clear()`), and
// NEU_STATE_BONUS_TALLY (the real `while(StageTime>=BonusRate){...
// Sound_Beep();WaitTimer(1);}` bonus-countdown loop - note this one genuinely
// combines *two* separate upstream waits per iteration, the tempo-based
// `Sound_Beep()` blocking duration *plus* one additional literal
// `WaitTimer(1)` tick after it finishes - `neuWaitFrames = neuNoteFrames(1)
// + 1` reproduces both together, the one bonus-tally-specific case where a
// sound wait and a raw tick wait stack, checked carefully against every
// other single-sound-wait state in this file to confirm none of the others
// have the same extra tick tacked on).
//
// **`TestMatching()` - the one piece of upstream control flow with no direct
// analogue anywhere in Cracky - needed its own genuinely new state,
// NEU_STATE_MATCH_REVEAL.** Landing a thrown card triggers a scan through
// every other floor card for one aligned within 2 cells on the same row/
// column; a match blocks for 30 real ticks (a literal `WaitTimer(30)`, not
// tempo-based - reproduced as a direct `neuWaitFrames=30`) then removes both
// cards and stops; a *mismatch* also blocks 30 ticks (showing both cards'
// real face value first) but then, subtly, does **not** stop - upstream's
// own `for` loop has no `return` on the mismatch branch, so it keeps
// scanning for *further* aligned candidates from the same landing event,
// each one getting its own independent 30-tick reveal, only stopping once
// either a real match is found or the scan reaches the end of the card
// list. Reproduced with `neuBeginMatchScan()`/`neuContinueMatchScan()` (a
// synchronous "skip past cards that don't qualify, stop and pause the whole
// game the instant one does" scan, re-entered after each mismatch resolves)
// and `neuUpdateMatchReveal()` (the 30-tick pause + resolve step) - and,
// since upstream's real `WaitTimer(30)` blocks the *entire* CPU (monster/
// solver/clock included, since nothing past `MoveCard()` in the same loop
// iteration can run until it returns), `NEU_STATE_MATCH_REVEAL` is a genuine
// top-level state that freezes gameplay entirely while active, the same way
// `NEU_STATE_DIE_ANIM` does - `neuUpdatePlaying()` bails out immediately
// (skipping `MoveMonsters()`/the clock/the RemainCardCount check for that
// tick) the instant `neuMoveCard()` triggers a reveal, matching upstream's
// real control flow exactly rather than letting monster movement sneak in
// on the same tick a card lands.
//
// **A real, if likely upstream-unpolished, ambiguity around dying while
// holding or having just thrown a card, resolved deliberately rather than
// replicated literally.** `InitStage()` (fresh wallmap+cards) only ever runs
// once per *stage*, not on a life-lost retry (`goto try_` resumes *after*
// it) - `InitCards()`'s own `pHeldCard=pThrownCard=nullptr` reset therefore
// never re-runs on retry either, so a card that was genuinely Held or
// in-flight (Thrown) at the exact moment of death would, in upstream, stay
// permanently stuck in that status forever (nothing ever puts it back),
// silently keeping `RemainCardCount` from ever reaching 0 for that one card.
// Whether this is an intentional harsh design choice or a genuine, never-
// noticed upstream oversight is impossible to tell from the source alone.
// Resolved here with `neuResetHeldOrThrownCardOnRetry()` (called from
// `neuInitTrying()`, so it runs on every retry as well as harmlessly on a
// fresh stage where there's nothing to reset): a Held card is simply
// returned to Floor status at its own already-unchanged x/y (its position
// was never touched while held); a Thrown card is snapped to Floor at its
// current in-flight position, rounded to the nearest cell the same way a
// normal landing does. A deliberate, documented, low-risk simplification of
// a genuinely underspecified edge case, not a literal port.
//
// **A real, pervasive AVR-implicit-byte-wraparound-reliance hazard, found by
// inspection before ever compiling - the same bug family this whole project
// has hit repeatedly, here showing up via two distinct mechanisms in the
// same file.** (1) `InitStage()`'s own wall-bitmap-building algorithm relies
// on two local `byte` variables (`wallBit`, `bit`) overflowing from 0x80<<1
// back to 0 to know when 8 bits have been consumed and it's time to advance
// to the next source byte - fixed the standard way, `& 0xFF` after every
// shift, explicit `==0` check. (2) Nearly every proximity/collision check in
// `Card.cpp`/`Monster.cpp` (`TestToMove()`, `TestMatching()`,
// `Monster_TestHit()`, `MoveMonsters()`'s own solver-collision check) uses
// the classic `static_cast<byte>(diff+N) < M` idiom to test "is this
// difference within a small range" by deliberately relying on a *negative*
// byte subtraction wrapping around to a large positive value rather than
// computing an absolute value - ported with an explicit `neuByteWrap()`
// helper (`v & 0xFF`, correct for negative `v` too since Vircon32 ints are
// genuine 32-bit two's complement, matching this project's own established
// use of the same trick for `md_drawColumn()`'s own byte-truncation fix)
// applied at each such site, reproducing the exact same wraparound-based
// range test. (3) A related, higher-stakes case: `SolverX`/`SolverY`/
// `CardX`/`CardY`/`Monster.x`/`Monster.y` are *all* declared `byte` upstream,
// meaning **every** arithmetic update to them (a step left/right/up/down, a
// card's own flight, a monster's own step) is itself an implicit 0-255
// wraparound - not just the two collision-check idioms above. A bare,
// unwrapped `newX = SolverX + dx` landing on a genuinely negative value
// before ever reaching `TestMap2()` would, on Vircon32's own *logical* (not
// arithmetic) right shift, corrupt `TestMap2()`'s own wall-bitmap-index
// arithmetic into a huge value rather than the small, safe, wrapped-to-255
// index real hardware would compute - fixed by applying `neuByteWrap()` at
// every point an upstream `byte`-typed position variable is written
// (`neuSolverMove()`'s/`neuMoveCard()`'s/`neuMoveMonsters()`'s own `newX`/
// `newY` locals) *and*, as a second, independent safety layer, at the entry
// of every function whose own upstream signature takes `byte x, byte y`
// parameters (`neuTestMap2()`, `neuTestToMove()`, `neuThrowCard()`,
// `neuMonsterTestHit()`, `neuShowSprite()`) - reproducing the real
// parameter-truncation semantic a `byte`-typed C++ parameter gives for free,
// regardless of what a caller passed in. `neuTestMap2()` additionally gets
// an explicit bounds guard on its own `neuWallMap[]` index before ever
// reading it (return `false`, i.e. "blocked", rather than an out-of-bounds
// read) - a defensive fix matching this project's own repeated "preserve
// behavior, guard the crash" precedent (e.g. Tiny Arena's `Lvl1` fix),
// since proving *by hand* that every wrapped coordinate always stays within
// the real 16-row map (rather than trusting the border-wall data to always
// prevent it) wasn't worth the risk of a subtly-wrong manual proof.
//
// **Frame-pacing: `NEU_TICK_DIVISOR = 1` (effectively unthrottled), a
// deliberate, reasoned choice rather than a direct port of a single
// `WaitTimer(N)` call.** Unlike most of this project's other genuine-rate
// throttled ports, NEURAS's own real hardware timing isn't a single combined
// logic-and-redraw divisor the way Cracky's `CRK_TICK_DIVISOR=8` is - it's a
// *redraw-only* throttle layered on top of logic that already runs at the
// full real 60Hz rate: the main `do..while` body calls `MoveSolver()`/
// `MoveCard()`/`MoveMonsters()` every single bare-loop iteration, with only
// the *redraw* (`if((clock&1)==0){DrawAll();WaitTimer(2);}`) skipped every
// other iteration purely to save real I2C bandwidth - over any 2 iterations,
// exactly one `WaitTimer(2)` call (~33ms) elapses, meaning each individual
// logic iteration still averages a genuine 1/60s of real time regardless of
// whether it happens to redraw. Matching this project's own repeated
// "drop the real-hardware VRAM-bandwidth redraw-skip trick, redraw every
// frame" precedent (Tiny Pacman's `FPS_Control` split, etc) rather than
// halving the solver's real movement speed by naively applying the
// `WaitTimer(2)` value as a logic-throttling divisor, `NEU_TICK_DIVISOR=1`
// (a no-op today, kept for structural symmetry with every other tick-gated
// port in this project and as an obvious single knob if retuning is ever
// wanted) reproduces the *true* ~60Hz logic rate directly, with every frame
// redrawn. This also happens to match the literal `WaitTimer(1)` value used
// elsewhere in this same file's own bonus-tally loop.
//
// EEPROM/persistent high-score save is out of scope for this port (upstream
// itself has its own `// word HiScore;`/`// if(Score>HiScore)` lines
// commented out - a real, deliberately-disabled feature on the original
// hardware too, left disabled here to match rather than added as a new
// enhancement).
//
// **A meticulous line-by-line re-verification pass against the real
// upstream source** (dispatched after this port's own initial batch-ported
// state was flagged, project-wide, as "not independently verified - some
// games in this batch don't draw well or have state-progression issues,
// exact games unnamed"). Every draw/compositing function, every data table
// (byte-diffed programmatically against the real `Stages.cpp`/`Chars.cpp`/
// `Sound.cpp` source, not eyeballed), every position/offset formula, and
// the entire state machine were traced against the real `.cpp` files
// line-by-line before ever touching the emulator - confirmed correct:
// `neuMapToVVram()`'s 3-pass wall-bit-to-glyph conversion (matches
// `MapToVVram()`'s own in-place-mutation read order exactly, including
// which neighbor reads see already-transformed vs. still-raw data);
// `neuVPut2()`/`neuDrawSpritesIntoVVram()`'s glyph-offset math (matches
// `VPut2()`/`DrawSprites()`'s own pointer arithmetic exactly); the whole
// map-area nibble-interleave in `neuComposeRawByte()` (matches `SendUL()`/
// `VVramToVram()`'s own formula exactly); `neuIconByte()`'s 2x2-icon
// nibble math (matches `Put2C()`'s own byte-pair-advance-through-4-glyphs
// trick exactly, re-derived by hand from the real pointer arithmetic);
// every stage's wall bytes/card positions+numbers/monster positions (all
// byte-identical, confirmed via a Python re-extraction script); every
// sound melody table (all 10, byte-identical, confirmed the same way);
// the tempo-to-real-frame formula (independently re-derived from
// `Timer.cpp`'s real 60Hz `SysTick`+`Sound.cpp`'s own `Tempo`/`600/2`
// accumulator, confirms `neuNoteFrames()`'s `*1.363636` constant exactly);
// `neuDecideMonsterDirection()` (matches `DecideDirection()` element-for-
// element, including the real upstream `SolverX < pMonster->y` typo
// already correctly preserved); `neuMoveMonsters()`'s stop-count wraparound
// stun timer (a deliberate 0-to-255 byte-wrap stun duration, correctly
// reproduced via `neuByteWrap()`); the whole card-matching scan/reveal
// state machine (`neuBeginMatchScan()`/`neuContinueMatchScan()`/
// `neuUpdateMatchReveal()`, confirmed to resume scanning from the same
// index a real C++ `for` loop's own monotonic pointer advance would);
// `neuMoveSolver()`'s direction-priority/`keyOn` logic (matches
// `MoveSolver()`'s own `goto moved`-based short-circuit exactly).
//
// **Two real bugs found this pass, both fixed:**
//
// 1. **A real, screenshot-confirmed title-screen rendering bug**, first
//    fixed with a narrow patch, then **fully re-fixed a second time** once
//    a real user-supplied hardware photo of the sibling game Cracky proved
//    that first patch's own root-cause diagnosis was wrong (see
//    `neuStatusChar`'s own header comment and `neuBeginTitle()`'s own
//    comment for the full corrected story - this entry is kept for
//    history). `neuPrintStatus()` (called at the very top of
//    `neuBeginTitle()`) claims pages 0 (SCORE label)/1 (score digits)/3
//    (STAGE label+number)/5 (TIME label+digits)/7 (remain-life icons,
//    shown whenever `neuRemainCount>1` - true on cold boot, since
//    `gameNeuras_init()` sets it to 3 before ever reaching the title
//    screen, matching upstream's own identical `Main()` sequence) - the
//    *original* 8-page x 8-column `neuStatusChar` status grid this port
//    started with genuinely only had columns 0-7 to work with at all, so
//    every one of those 5 status pages left just pages 2/4/6 free, and
//    "MINI"/"START"/"CONTINUE" collided with SCORE/STAGE/TIME's own text
//    (screenshotted at the time as garbled "MINIE 01", "▸START 0", and a
//    genuine out-of-bounds write - `neuStatusChar[6][8]` silently aliasing
//    to `neuStatusChar[7][0]` via the flat row-major layout, corrupting
//    the credit line's own first letter). The *first* fix (dropping
//    "MINI"/the "INUFUTO" credit line outright, moving "START" to page 4,
//    truncating "CONTINUE" to "CONTINU") made this port render cleanly,
//    but was a symptom patch: it never questioned whether the 8-column
//    grid itself was the right model. Once Cracky's own real hardware
//    photo proved upstream's actual Vram canvas is a genuine 32-column-
//    per-page space (status labels confined to columns 24-31, title text
//    living at columns 8-23 - never actually colliding with anything on
//    real hardware), `neuStatusChar` was widened to `[8][32]` and
//    `neuBeginTitle()` was rewritten a second time to place every piece of
//    text (now including the previously-dropped "MINI" and "INUFUTO 2026"
//    credit line, and the full un-truncated "CONTINUE") at its real
//    upstream column - see that function's own current comment for the
//    exact columns used. Verified via a rebuilt-and-rescreenshotted title
//    screen showing every element ("NEURAS"/"MINI"/"SCORE"/"STAGE"/
//    "▸START"/"CONTINUE"/"TIME"/"INUFUTO 2026"/life icons) rendering fully,
//    non-overlapping, and un-truncated.
//
// 2. **A real timing-fidelity bug in the match-reveal pause**, found by
//    precisely deriving the real-time duration of `Sound_Hit()`/
//    `Sound_Miss()` from `Sound.cpp`'s own real tempo math (8 notes x
//    `neuNoteFrames(1)` = 8 real frames) and comparing it against how the
//    port's own `neuContinueMatchScan()` used it. Upstream's own
//    `TestMatching()` calls `Sound_Hit()`/`Sound_Miss()` - which
//    genuinely BLOCK the whole CPU via `WaitMelody()`'s busy-wait until
//    the cue finishes playing - and only THEN starts the separate,
//    literal `WaitTimer(30)` (`Sound_Hit(); WaitTimer(30);`, sequential,
//    not concurrent) - a real total pause of ~38-41 real ticks, not just
//    30. This project's own multi-voice `md_playTone()` (see the top-level
//    CLAUDE.md's own writeup of that change) means the port's SFX channel
//    and its own `neuWaitFrames` countdown run CONCURRENTLY instead,
//    which - unlike upstream's real blocking call - meant the previous
//    `neuWaitFrames=30` alone under-counted the true pause by the sound's
//    own ~8-tick duration (since 8 < 30, the sound was already finished
//    well before the reveal resolved, contributing nothing extra). This
//    is the exact same bug shape this port's own `neuUpdateBonusTally()`
//    already correctly handles for its own `Sound_Beep()`+`WaitTimer(1)`
//    stack (`neuWaitFrames = neuNoteFrames(1) + 1`) - simply not also
//    applied here at initial port time. **Fixed** with a new
//    `neuMelodyTotalFrames(id)` helper (sums `neuNoteFrames()` across
//    every note of a melody) and `neuWaitFrames = 30 +
//    neuMelodyTotalFrames(NEU_MELODY_HIT/MISS)` in `neuContinueMatchScan()`
//    - a ~27% longer, now-faithful reveal pause. A purely-timing fix (the
//    match/mismatch resolution itself, the score, and the card state were
//    all already correct before this) - verified by rebuilding cleanly
//    and re-confirming, via Puppeteer, that picking up and throwing a
//    card still renders correctly through the pickup (auto-triggered by
//    walking onto a floor card, matching upstream's own `PickCard()`
//    call inside `MoveSolver()` with no button gating) and throw sequence
//    with no corruption, though this specific improvised test throw
//    happened not to land aligned with another card, so the reveal state
//    itself wasn't re-screenshotted after this exact fix - low risk, since
//    the fix only changes a wait-duration constant, not any control flow,
//    and the state's own rendering was already screenshot-verified
//    correct (2x-zoomed pixel measurements confirming the held-card icon
//    and remain-life icons render at their correct, non-overlapping page
//    positions) earlier in the same session.
//
// Also specifically re-examined, per this pass's own instructions to
// treat every "not independently verified"/"deviation"/"simplification"
// note as a real lead: the deliberate held/thrown-card retry resolution
// (confirmed reasonable, no upstream "correct" answer exists to compare
// against - a real, inherently ambiguous edge case, not a bug); the
// initial monster-facing-direction default (`NEU_DIR_LEFT` instead of a
// null-equivalent sentinel - confirmed deliberate and safety-motivated,
// since upstream's own literal behavior there is an unavoidably undefined
// null-pointer dereference with no faithful port possible, and the actual
// behavioral difference is confined to one narrow initial-direction tie-
// break case with no crash risk either way); `neuCurrentStage`'s
// unbounded `int` growth vs. upstream's real `byte` wraparound-at-256
// (confirmed to compute an identical `neuStageIndex` regardless, since
// 8 divides 256 evenly - the display-only divergence would only start
// after 256 consecutive stage clears in one sitting, judged not worth
// guarding against). None of these needed a code change.

// from the start - see neuStatusChar's own header comment, and
// gameCracky.c's own crkBeginTitle() comment, for the full story.** The
// previous version of this function (see git history / the CLAUDE.md
// writeup of this exact fix) treated the earlier out-of-bounds/collision
// bug as proof that upstream's own title text genuinely has nowhere to
// go - so it dropped "MINI" and the "INUFUTO" credit line outright and
// truncated "CONTINUE" to "CONTINU". Re-reading upstream's real
// `Status.cpp` (`Title()`) line by line shows that diagnosis was
// backwards: upstream's own Vram address space is a genuinely wide
// 32-char-cell-per-page canvas, the status labels occupy only columns
// 24-31 (`LeftX=24`), and every piece of title-screen text sits at
// columns 0-23 (the real "NEURAS" bitmap logo, columns 8-23 for "MINI"),
// 9-16 ("START"/"CONTINUE", with the cursor arrow at column 8), and 12-23
// (the "INUFUTO 2026" credit line) - all genuinely clear of the status
// labels' own columns. The ROOT problem was this port's own
// `neuStatusChar` being modeled as an 8-column-wide grid in the first
// place - now fixed there, this function places everything at upstream's
// real, literal columns, with `neuFullWidthText=true` so
// neuComposeRawByte() renders the full canvas instead of just the narrow
// status zone.
//
// **Rewritten a THIRD time to fix a second, separate architectural bug
// found in the sibling game Cracky (see that file's own header comment,
// `crkBeginTitle()`'s own comment, and CLAUDE.md's own "A second, related
// architectural issue" writeup): the earlier version of this function
// still simplified upstream's real, prominent 96-value pixel-art
// "NEURAS" wordmark logo (`Status.cpp`'s own `TitleBytes[]` table, the
// single biggest, most visually important element on the whole title
// screen) down to plain small ASCII text - reasoning it was "purely
// decorative". That reasoning was wrong, the same way it was wrong for
// Cracky's own "CRACKY" logo: it's not filler, it's the actual title
// wordmark. Restored to the real bitmap below, drawn directly into
// neuVVram from neuTitleBytes[] at its own real position (VVram rows 2-5,
// i.e. real hardware pages 1-2 - matching upstream's `Status.cpp`

// exactly, where `TitleLeft = (VVramWidth(24) - 4*TitleLength(6))/2 = 0`
// here, same as Cracky's own logo, since both titles are also 6 letters
// long). neuComposeRawByte() was updated to OR-combine this VVram content
