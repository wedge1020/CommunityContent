// =============================================================================
// IMPETUS mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, license "None specified" -
// GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_impetus`) - a vertically-
// scrolling shoot-em-up: steer a fighter left/right/up/down across a 24x16
// virtual grid, shooting sky enemies (3 AI archetypes), ground turrets, drop
// barriers, and a periodic multi-hit "fort" boss, while the terrain scrolls
// upward underneath. Endless play across 8 hand-authored stages (looping
// forever, difficulty scaling with CurrentStage) - 3 lives, real in-session
// score tracking (upstream has no EEPROM at all - a CH32V003 RISC-V
// microcontroller, not AVR, same platform family as this project's own
// already-shipped `gameCracky.c`, its primary structural reference here).
//
// Ported directly following gameCracky.c's own established methodology -
// same author, same hardware family, same real 60Hz SysTick timer
// (`Timer.cpp`), same `ScanKeys.h` 4-direction+1-button input scheme (a
// strict subset of what `tinyJoypadShim.h` already exposes - isFire2Pressed()
// goes unused here too), same two-level VVram/CharPattern tile-rendering
// system, same 3-tone-channel software mixer in `Sound.cpp`. No new shim
// primitive was needed.
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform is applied, on purpose** -
// `InitOled()` here sends the exact same `OledCmd::RightToLeft`/
// `OledCmd::BottomToTop` register pair Cracky's own `InitOled()` sends, and
// Cracky's own header comment documents at length why a from-first-
// principles "fix" for those settings is *wrong*: on real UIAPduino/SSD1306
// hardware they compensate for a physical panel-mounting quirk with no
// equivalent to correct for in a software recreation. `impComposeMapByte()`
// draws directly at its own (col,page) - no mirroring, no bit-reversal.
//
// **Rendering is the same two-level VVram/CharPattern tile system as
// Cracky, reused via the identical nibble-interleave formula** (`SendUL()`'s
// own `(upper&0xF)|(lower<<4)` / `(upper>>4)|(lower&0xF0)` split, verified
// byte-identical between the two games' own `Vram.cpp` before ever writing
// `impComposeMapByte()` - not re-derived from scratch). Diverges from Cracky
// in one structural way: Cracky's own status text lives entirely within a
// fixed columns-96-127 side panel; this game's real `Status.cpp`/`Title()`
// write text (SCORE/STAGE/lives, and the whole title screen: logo/MINI/
// INUFUTO/START/CONTINUE/cursor) via raw `PrintC()`/`Put2C()` hardware-direct
// calls that land at BOTH the columns-96-127 status area *and* within the
// columns-0-95 map area itself (e.g. "GAME OVER" at column 32, "START" at
// column 36) - a real VRAM-persistence case, the same class already found
// and fixed in Cracky's own `PrintTimeUp()`/`PrintGameOver()` (see that
// file's own header comment). Rather than replicate Cracky's narrower
// "columns 96-127 status grid + a separate ad-hoc message overlay" split,
// this port unifies both into ONE general `impTextChar[8][32]` grid spanning
// the *entire* 128-column width (32 char-cells, matching `VramStep`'s own
// real 4-column granularity) - any non-space cell overrides the map's own
// composited byte for that exact position; columns >=96 have no map content
// at all, so a space cell there just renders blank. This is simpler than
// Cracky's own split needed to be, since Cracky's own title-screen
// simplification (see below) never had to draw text over its own map area
// in the first place.
//
// **`Put2C()` (a real 2x2 `CharPattern`-glyph hardware-direct write, used
// only for the "lives remaining" fighter-icon indicator) is simplified to
// plain digit/blank text, matching Cracky's own established precedent for
// this exact situation** (`PrintStatus()`'s own "upstream draws a real 2x2
// Char_Remain icon (Put2C) here... simplified to plain text digits
// throughout" - Cracky's header comment) - `impPrintStatus()` reproduces
// the identical two-branch shape (blank cells only when `RemainCount-1<=2`,
// a digit when `>2`), not a different simplification of my own invention.
//
// **The title screen's own real logo bitmap (`TitleBytes[96]`, drawn
// directly into VVram) was ORIGINALLY simplified to plain text, matching
// Cracky's own now-known-WRONG original decision for its own "CRACKY" logo
// bitmap - restored here to the real bitmap for the exact same reason
// Cracky's own was restored (see that file's own header comment in full:
// a genuine user-supplied photo of Cracky running on real UIAPduino
// hardware proved this logo is NOT decorative filler - it's the single
// largest, most prominent element on the whole title screen, and the
// small ASCII font is even missing several of the letters it would need to
// spell most titles out anyway).** `impTitleBytes[96]` is upstream's own
// real `Status.cpp`/`Title()` `TitleBytes[]` table (6 glyph-slots x 4x4
// VVram cells each, byte-diff-extracted from the real upstream source, not
// hand-transcribed), drawn into `impVVram` at real VVram rows 2-5 (`VVram +
// VVramWidth*2 + TitleLeft`, and `TitleLeft = (VVramWidth - 4*TitleLength)/2
// = 0` here, since `4*TitleLength = 4*6 = 24 = IMP_VVRAM_WIDTH` exactly -
// the logo fills the full VVram width with no left margin) - real hardware
// pages 1-2, matching Cracky's own logo placement exactly (same author,
// same `Status.cpp` shape, same VVram row offset). "MINI" moved from its
// old, wrong, arbitrary column (8) to upstream's own real computed column,
// `TitleLeft + 4*TitleLength - 5 = 19`, at page 3 (row 6/7, safely below
// the logo's own pages 1-2). `impComposeMapByte()`'s first 32 bytes
// (indices 0-15, the logo's own valid glyph range) were independently
// confirmed byte-identical to Cracky's own `crkCharPattern`'s identical
// range before trusting reuse, matching this shared driver family's own
// established "logo" `CharPattern` block (both games' real `Chars.cpp`
// literally comment that block `//logo`).
//
// **`impRender()`'s own text-vs-map compositing was deliberately NOT
// switched to an unconditional OR-combine, unlike Cracky's own
// `crkComposeRawByte()` fix** - a real behavioral difference from Cracky
// worth explaining rather than blindly mirroring. Cracky's own status-text
// grid (`crkStatusChar`) is NEVER written to for columns inside the map
// area (col<96) during real gameplay at all (its own "GAME OVER"/"TIME UP"
// messages bypass `crkComposeRawByte()` entirely via a separate
// `crkOverlayActive` branch in `crkRender()`) - so an unconditional OR
// there is genuinely safe, since map and status-text content never
// actually coexist in the same cell outside the title screen. This game's
// own `impTextChar` grid is architecturally different (see this file's own
// header comment further up) - it's the ONE mechanism used both for the
// status zone AND for text printed directly into the map area during real
// gameplay ("GAME OVER" at charCol 8-16, page 4), and that in-map text
// case genuinely NEEDS the exclusive-override behavior already fixed once
// in this same file (see finding 1 in the verification-pass writeup below,
// `impPrintC()`'s own `asciiIndex+1` fix) - an unconditional OR would
// silently let the frozen terrain underneath "GAME OVER" bleed back
// through both its embedded space AND every letter's own dark pixels,
// undoing that fix. Instead, `impRender()` OR-combines `impComposeMapByte()`
// with the text layer ONLY while `impState == IMP_STATE_TITLE` (the real
// analogue of Cracky's own `crkFullWidthText` gate) - during the title
// screen this is pure defense-in-depth (the logo's own pages 1-2 and every
// piece of title-screen text are confirmed disjoint by construction, so
// the OR never actually changes anything there either), while every other
// state keeps the original, already-verified exclusive-choice behavior
// gameplay's own in-map text depends on.
//
// **The main loop's own `Clock`-gated update cadence is reproduced exactly,
// not simplified away** - upstream's `loop:` runs a mix of conditions keyed
// off a free-running `Clock` byte (`Clock&1==0` gates Fighter/EnemyBullet
// movement AND the whole draw+`WaitTimer(6)` pair; `Clock&3==0` gates Sky/
// Barrier/Item; `Clock&7==0` gates Fort; `Clock&15==0` gates ground-scroll/
// GroundEnemy; `MoveFighterBullets()` is the only call with NO gate at all)
// - and, critically, `WaitTimer(6)` (the real frame-rate throttle) *only
// ever executes on even Clock values*, meaning every "real tick" upstream
// is actually TWO back-to-back loop iterations: one gated/throttled/drawn
// (even Clock), immediately followed by one fast, undrawn, ungated-except-
// for-MoveFighterBullets() iteration (odd Clock) with zero real delay
// before the next real wait. The net observable effect: fighter bullets
// move at 2x the rate of everything else. Ported as `impAdvanceOneClockTick()`
// called TWICE per real throttled engine tick (once for the even-Clock
// gated pass, once for the odd-Clock fighter-bullets-only pass) - since the
// tick this port is entered on is always even by construction, the several
// `(Clock&1)==0` checks that are unconditionally true at that entry point
// (MoveFighter/MoveEnemyBullets, UpdateBangs+DrawAll) are written directly
// rather than re-tested, with a comment explaining why.
//
// **`IMP_TICK_DIVISOR = 6`**, from `WaitTimer(6)` - the same real 60Hz
// SysTick timer as Cracky (`Timer.cpp`'s own `kTimerHz=60`), just a
// different divisor value (Cracky's own game used `WaitTimer(8)`).
//
// **Sound**: same real 3-tone-channel software mixer as Cracky
// (`Sound.cpp`), but `Tempo=180` here (not Cracky's 160) - re-derived the
// note-duration formula from scratch rather than reusing Cracky's own
// 1.875 multiplier: `SoundHandler()`'s real advance interval is
// `(600/2)/Tempo` real 60Hz ticks, giving `300/180 = 1.6667` here.
// `impNoteFrames(length) = round(length * 1.6667)`. Every melody table
// (`Sound_Fire`/`Sound_Up`/`Sound_Start`/`Sound_GameOver`/`StartBGM`'s own
// two simultaneous voices) was byte-diff-extracted via a small Python
// script (resolving the real `NoteLength`/`Scale` enum values), not hand-
// transcribed - `impFrequencies[40]` was independently confirmed byte-
// identical to Cracky's own `crkFrequencies[40]` before reuse (both games
// share the exact same equal-tempered E2..G5 table). Routed through the
// same `crkStartSeq`/`crkAdvanceOneSeq`-shaped sequencer as Cracky
// (3 independent voices: 0=one-shot SFX reused for Fire/Up, 1=jingle/BGM-
// voice-A, 2=BGM-voice-B), safe against collision the same way Cracky's
// own header explains (`md_playTone()` is genuinely multi-voice project-
// wide - see this project's own CLAUDE.md).
//
// This game also has a real `EffectChannel` (a decaying noise burst via a
// software LFSR, `Sound_SmallBang()`/`Sound_LargeBang()` - a genuinely
// different sound-generation mechanism than the tone channels, with no
// Vircon32 equivalent for true noise). Approximated as a single, short,
// representative `md_playTone()` blip at the same base frequency
// (3000Hz/1500Hz) rather than the real ~0.89-second linear volume-decay
// duration the raw timer math computes (`MaxVolume=63`, decrementing by 2
// per advance-tick, `~32 advance-ticks * 1.6667 / 60 ~= 0.89s`) - a
// deliberate simplification, since a held ~0.89s tone (especially with
// several enemies destroyed in quick succession, each grabbing its own
// free `md_playTone()` channel with no envelope/decay of its own) would
// read as an odd sustained drone rather than the intended quick "bang",
// matching this project's own established "no exact noise equivalent,
// use a short representative tone" precedent (e.g. UFO's own thruster hum).
//
// **Data extraction**: `Chars.cpp` (`AsciiPattern`/`CharPattern`) and the
// whole of `Stages.cpp` (`MapBytes[768]`, 54 `Tiles[16]` glyph blocks, 8
// `SkyElementsN[]` tables, 8 `GroundElementsN[]` tables each cross-
// referencing one of 38 named `RouteXBY[]` tables, and the final `Stages[8]`
// stitching them together) were extracted via a small Python script
// (parsing the real array literals directly, resolving `Char_X + N`
// expressions against `Chars.h`'s own real constants) rather than hand-
// transcribed, with every count cross-checked against upstream's own
// `Char_End`/array-length invariants before ever being pasted in - the
// same "byte-diff transcribed tables" discipline this project has needed
// repeatedly (Tiny Bomber's own dropped-byte bug is the canonical example).
// `AsciiPattern[108]` was independently confirmed byte-identical to
// Cracky's own `crkAsciiPattern[108]` (both games share the exact same
// " 0123456789>ACEFGIMNOPRSTUV" font) before reuse.
//
// **All of `Stages.cpp`'s own C++ struct cross-references (`GroundElement.
// pRoute`, `Stage.pSkyElements`, `Stage.pGroundElement` - real pointers
// into other const arrays) were flattened into explicit array indices
// instead**, matching this project's own established "resolve by id/index,
// not a raw pointer into game data" precedent (e.g. Tiny Dungeon's own
// bitmap-array resolver) - a lower-risk, more conservative choice than
// trusting untested pointer-into-a-data-table semantics on this dialect,
// even though plain struct pointers are confirmed to work elsewhere. Every
// stage's own `SkyElementsN[]`/`GroundElementsN[]` tables were concatenated
// into one flat `impSkyElem*[70]`/`impGroundElem*[142]` pair (with each
// stage's own `impStageSkyStart`/`impStageGroundStart` marking where its
// own slice begins), and every named `RouteXBY[]` table was concatenated
// into one flat `impRoute*[83]` (with each ground element's own
// `impGroundElemRS` marking where its own route slice begins) - built by
// the same extraction script, in first-use (stage) order, not re-derived
// by hand.
//
// **A genuine, real upstream out-of-bounds-array-read bug, fixed with an
// explicit clamp rather than reproduced** - the single riskiest finding
// of this whole port, caught by inspection before ever compiling, not by
// a crash. `GroundEnemy::pRoute` (a raw pointer walking one of the 38
// named `RouteXBY[]` arrays) is advanced every time a route leg's own
// `moveCount` reaches 0
// (`++pEnemy->pRoute; auto pRoute=pEnemy->pRoute; pEnemy->dx=pRoute->dx; ...`)
// - gated behind `if (pEnemy->routeCount > 0)`, which reads as "keep
// cycling while there are more route legs left." But `pEnemy->routeCount`
// is set ONCE at spawn (from the ground element's own real leg count) and
// is *never decremented* anywhere in this file - the intended decrement
// is a literal dead, commented-out line (`// pEnemy->routeCount;`,
// presumably meant to be `--pEnemy->routeCount;`, disabled by the original
// author and apparently never reinstated). Since the gate condition can
// therefore never become false, `++pEnemy->pRoute` walks PAST the real end
// of its own array (2-3 entries typically) the very first time it would
// otherwise "finish" a route, reading whatever memory happens to sit right
// after that specific `const Route[]` array in the compiled binary -
// undefined behavior, silently harmless on real embedded flash (an
// adjacent-static-data read, further bounded by the enemy scrolling off
// screen before it usually matters), but a genuine out-of-bounds global
// read on this platform - the exact class of bug this project's own
// history (Tiny Arena's `Lvl1[9][9]` off-by-one, Tiny Gilbert's key-search
// bound) has repeatedly found and fixed with an explicit clamp rather than
// reproduced. **Fixed** by tracking each ground enemy's own real route-leg
// count (`impGeRouteTotal[i]`, from the ground element's own true
// `impGroundElemRC` value) and its current position within that count
// (`impGeRouteIndex[i]`), clamping the advance so it can reach the LAST
// real leg and then simply hold there indefinitely (continuing along its
// final known direction forever) instead of ever reading past the flat
// `impRouteDx`/`Dy`/`Count` table's own real per-enemy slice. This
// preserves upstream's own observable intent (the `routeCount>0` check is
// clearly meant to allow indefinite cycling) without the real memory-
// safety risk.
//
// **The rest of the upstream `byte`/wraparound-as-a-feature idioms already
// well-documented in this project's own CLAUDE.md (byte-truncation bugs,
// AVR/CH32-narrow-type reliance) were replaced with provably-equivalent
// signed-range checks instead of literal `&0xFF`-style masking**, since
// every case here happens to be tightly bounded and admits a clean signed-
// comparison equivalent (documented at each site below), rather than
// reproducing the wraparound mechanism itself:
//   - `DrawGround()`'s own `byte yPos = GroundY;` (GroundY always in
//     [-4,-1]) relies on unsigned-byte wraparound to make "still above the
//     visible area" register as `>= VVramHeight` (false for `<16`) exactly
//     when logically negative. Since the real, unwrapped range of every
//     `yPos` value this function ever computes is provably [-4,18] (a
//     small, fixed range - see `impDrawGround()`'s own comment for the
//     derivation), a plain signed `destRow>=0 && destRow<16` check is
//     exactly equivalent and needs no masking at all - `impDrawGround()`
//     is rewritten as an explicit (groundRow,groundCol,subRow,subCol)
//     nested loop instead of replicating the original's own raw
//     `pVVram`/`pGround` pointer walk (which transiently points *before*
//     the real array start - real undefined behavior even on the original
//     platform - not something worth reproducing literally).
//   - `Fort::DrawFort()`'s own `y = FortY - Height;` (always <= 0, given
//     `FortY` never exceeds `MaxY=6` and `Height=6`) relies on the same
//     wraparound trick via `while (y >= VVramHeight)`; replaced with a
//     plain `while (y < 0)`.
//   - Every "is this bullet/enemy/barrier still active" check
//     (`pX->y >= RangeY` as the *inactive* sentinel, relying on `y`
//     wrapping to a large positive byte both for its initial `0xff`
//     sentinel value and for any negative in-flight position) is ported
//     as a genuinely signed field defaulting to `-1`, checked via
//     `y < 0 || y >= RangeY` wherever upstream checked `y >= RangeY`
//     alone - `EnemyBullet`'s own diagonal Bresenham-style velocity
//     accumulator (`numeratorX/Y`, `denominatorX/Y`) needed no such
//     change, since those fields never rely on wraparound themselves.
//   - `Bang::Show()`'s own `x -= 1; y -= 1; if (x < RangeX && y < RangeY)`
//     (an edge-of-screen guard relying on `x`/`y` wrapping to a large byte
//     when the bang's own quadrant offset would go negative) is ported as
//     a plain `x>=0 && x<RangeX && y>=0 && y<RangeY` check on signed ints.
//
// **A genuine, faithfully-preserved upstream quirk, left exactly as
// observed rather than "fixed"**: `Bang::UpdateBangs()`'s own
// `++count; if (count >= 1) {...}` is - once actually traced - always
// true on the very first tick a bang exists (`count` starts at 0, so
// `++count` makes it 1, and `1 >= 1` is unconditionally true) - meaning
// the `else` branch (`pBang->status = mode | count;`, which would hold a
// bang's own animation phase for more than one tick) is dead code, and a
// small bang flashes for exactly one real tick, a large bang for exactly
// two (one tick each for its "small" and "large-quadrant" phases) before
// vanishing. This reads as a real, if likely-unintentional, quirk rather
// than a deliberate design choice - kept exactly as written, matching this
// project's own "preserve a faithful, even if odd, upstream comparison
// rather than silently fixing it" precedent (already used once in Cracky's
// own `Monster.cpp` port). An earlier draft of this comment also claimed
// `SkyEnemy::DecideDirection()`'s own upstream had a similar cross-axis
// comparison typo ("Man.x < pMonster->y") preserved here too - re-checked
// directly against the real upstream `SkyEnemy.cpp` during a later
// verification pass and that claim was simply wrong: `DecideDirection()`'s
// `Type_Smart` branch correctly compares `FighterX` against `pEnemy->x`
// and `FighterY` against `pEnemy->y` on both axes, with no typo anywhere,
// and `impDecideDirectionSky()` already ports it exactly that way. No
// upstream source, no game in this project, actually contains that
// "Man.x < pMonster->y" line - corrected here rather than left standing.
//
// **A real declaration-order constraint, solved by careful function
// ordering rather than forward declarations**: unlike Cracky's own mostly-
// linear (acyclic) call graph, this game's collision/movement web is
// genuinely cyclic at the *module* level - `Fighter::MoveFighter()` needs
// `FighterBullet::StartFighterBullet()`, which (via its own `Hit()` helper)
// needs `SkyEnemy`/`GroundEnemy`/`Barrier`/`Fort`'s own `HitBullet*`
// functions, which in turn need `EnemyBullet::StartEnemyBullet()`, which
// itself needs `Fighter::HitBulletFighter()` - closing the loop back to
// Fighter. Resolved by splitting `Fighter`'s own functions into two
// groups at different points in the file: its "predicate" functions
// (`impHitBulletFighter`/`impHitEnemyFighter`, plus `impFighterCrash`/
// `Show`/`Hide`/`impInitFighter`, none of which ever call into
// `FighterBullet`) are defined early, breaking the cycle; `impMoveFighter`
// itself (the one function that genuinely needs `FighterBullet`'s own
// `impStartFighterBullet`) is defined only once every other module it
// depends on already exists. The full definition order used throughout
// this file, and why each step is safe, is documented inline at each
// section boundary below.
//
// **A meticulous post-ship verification pass** (this game was originally
// ported by a different agent in a large parallel batch and only test-
// compiled, never played) re-checked every data table byte-for-byte via a
// Python re-extraction of the real upstream source (`impMapBytes`/
// `impTilesData`/every `impSkyElem*`/`impGroundElem*`/`impRoute*`/every
// `impStage*` table/`impAsciiPattern`/`impCharPattern`/`impFrequencies`/
// all 6 melody tables - all confirmed byte-identical, zero transcription
// errors found), re-traced the entire state machine and every gameplay
// function (Fighter/FighterBullet/EnemyBullet/SkyEnemy/GroundEnemy/Fort/
// Barrier/Bang/Item/Sprite/Stage) line-by-line against the real upstream
// `.cpp` files, and confirmed the CPU stays comfortably under budget in
// both the title screen (~38-45%) and busy gameplay (~44-51% CPU, ~7-10%
// GPU) via the WebGL perf overlay - no CPU-overrun-driven frame
// truncation found here (unlike the sibling "Ascend" game from the same
// batch). Found and fixed two real bugs, both confirmed live via a
// Puppeteer/WebGL test instance:
//
// 1) **A rendering-fidelity bug in the shared text overlay, affecting
// any printed string with an embedded space positioned over the map area
// (col<96)** - most visibly "GAME OVER" (page4, charCol8-16, with a
// space at charCol12 between the two words). `impPrintC()` originally
// stored `impAsciiIndex(c)` directly into `impTextChar`, and space is
// index 0 in the ascii table - meaning a printed space was
// indistinguishable from "nothing ever printed here", so `impRender()`'s
// own `impTextChar[page][charCol] != 0` check fell through to
// `impComposeMapByte()` for that exact cell, letting whatever map/sprite
// content was underneath (the frozen gameplay scene, for "GAME OVER")
// show through the gap instead of a clean blank. Upstream's own real
// `PrintC()` has no such distinction - it's a direct hardware write that
// unconditionally draws real pixels (including blank ones for a space),
// physically overwriting whatever was on the OLED at that column
// regardless of what's underneath. **Fixed** by storing `asciiIndex+1`
// (never 0) so a literal space is a real, distinct "draw a blank glyph"
// value rather than "no override" - `impRender()`'s lookup subtracts 1
// back off before indexing `impAsciiPattern`. Verified visually via a
// forced-game-over test (see finding 2 below): "GAME OVER" now shows a
// clean blank gap between the two words instead of the dotted terrain
// texture bleeding through it.
//
// 2) **A genuine upstream out-of-bounds melody-table read that hangs the
// game over screen indefinitely on this platform** - found via live play
// (a temporary debug hook forcing `RemainCount` to 0 after ~2 real
// seconds of play, to reach Game Over quickly; removed again once this
// was fixed and confirmed). `Sound_GameOver()`'s own `notes[]` table is
// missing the trailing terminator sentinel every *other* melody in this
// file has (Fire/Up/Start all end with an explicit extra `0`; both
// `StartBGM()` voices end with an explicit extra `0xff`) - it's exactly
// 18 bytes (9 length/note pairs), with nothing after the last pair to
// signal "stop". Confirmed directly against the real upstream source,
// not a transcription slip. On real hardware this silently reads
// whatever static data sits next in flash (harmless there, since some
// nearby byte is eventually 0) - ported as a fixed-size `int[18]`
// global with no bounds check anywhere in `impMelodyValue()`, reading
// past its end instead walks into `impMelodyBgm1`/`impMelodyBgm2`/
// further persistent game globals as if they were melody bytes, with no
// guarantee any of that data ever contains a literal 0 again within a
// reasonable time. Symptom, confirmed via the debug-forced test: the
// "GAME OVER" screen (jingle playing on channel 1) never returned to the
// title screen at all - `impSeqPlaying(1)` never became false. **Fixed**
// with an explicit bounds check in `impAdvanceOneSeq()` against
// `impMelodyLength()` (already tracks each table's own real element
// count) - reaching or passing the true end of a melody's data is always
// treated as "stop", covering all 6 melody tables uniformly rather than
// patching `impMelodyGameOver` specifically. Re-verified with the same
// debug hook: the game over screen now reliably returns to the title
// screen within the jingle's own real ~2.7s duration, both title and
// game-over screens rendering cleanly on the way.
//
// Also fixed: `impStopBgm()` only stopped sequencer channels 1/2 (the
// two BGM voices), but upstream's real `StopBGM()` resets ALL 3
// `ToneChannel`s, including channel 0 (the one-shot Fire/Up SFX voice) -
// added the missing `impStopSeq(0)` so an in-flight Fire/Up blip gets
// silenced along with the BGM the instant a game ends, matching upstream
// exactly, instead of being left free to keep advancing its own queued
// notes straight through the game-over jingle. And: an earlier revision
// of this header comment claimed `SkyEnemy::DecideDirection()`'s own
// upstream had a cross-axis comparison typo ("Man.x < pMonster->y")
// preserved faithfully here too - re-checked directly against the real
// upstream `SkyEnemy.cpp` during this pass and that claim was simply
// wrong (both axes are compared correctly, matching what
// `impDecideDirectionSky()` already does) - corrected above rather than
// left standing.
//
// Everything else audited came back clean: every `impMoveFighter`/
// `impStartFighterBullet`/`impMoveEnemyBullets`/`impStartSkyEnemy`/
// `impMoveSkyEnemies`/`impStartGroundEnemy`/`impMoveGroundEnemy`/
// `impMoveFort`/`impStartBarrier`/`impMoveBarriers`/`impUpdateBangs`/
// `impMoveItem` function traced line-by-line against upstream with no
// further discrepancies; every signed-range/shift-safety rewrite
// documented above re-derived and confirmed still correct; the
// `impGeRouteIndex`/`impGeRouteTotal` route-advance clamp (the original
// port's own headline fix) re-verified against the real, never-
// decremented upstream `routeCount` field; `impDrawGround()`'s own
// (groundRow,subRow) coverage re-proven (by hand, for every real
// `impGroundY` value in its documented [-4,-1] range) to always cover
