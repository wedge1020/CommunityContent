// =============================================================================
// Tiny Pipe - ported from Daniel C's Tiny-Pipe.ino (tinyjoypad.com, GPLv3).
// Same tinyJoypadShim lineage as every other Daniel-C game here
// (FastTinyDriver.h) - Sound()/isXPressed() reuse the existing shim as-is.
//
// A Mappy/Pengo-style single-screen platformer: bounce on the pipework to
// knock turtles over from below (via a bump indicator or an "earthquake"
// stomp), then walk into a stunned turtle to kick it off screen for
// points; touching an un-stunned turtle costs a life. Clear all the
// turtles in a level to advance; 3 lives, 20 levels (capped).
//
// Button mapping (matches every other Daniel-C game's own established A0
// thresholds, confirmed directly against this game's own ELECTROLIB.h):
//   analogRead(A0) in (500,750) = isRightPressed()
//   analogRead(A0) in [750,950) = isLeftPressed()
//   digitalRead(1) (active low) = isFirePressed() - jump, and confirm on
//     the title screen. No up/down input exists in this game at all.
//
// Structural changes from upstream:
//  - `CLASS_TPIPE.h` declares two real C++ classes with a small, flat
//    inheritance step (`PASIVE_SPRITE_TPIPE`, and `SPRITE_TPIPE : public
//    PASIVE_SPRITE_TPIPE`) - the same shape already solved for Tiny
//    Missile's own `CLASS_TMISSILE.h`, not the harder full-hierarchy
//    complexity that keeps TinyDungeon/SQuest/DDug deferred. Flattened
//    into one `TpipeSprite` struct (every field from both classes inlined
//    together - the base class's fields are simply unused by the
//    "Target" bump-indicator instance, which only ever needed
//    `PASIVE_SPRITE_TPIPE`'s own subset) with plain `tpipe*` functions
//    taking an explicit pointer instead of methods.
//  - upstream's loop() is a `New_Game:`/`Next_Level:` goto-chain around
//    one big `while(1)`, with several genuinely blocking pieces beyond
//    the usual goto-chain shape - rewritten as an explicit frame-stepped
//    state machine (tpipeState), same approach as every other
//    tinyJoypadShim port here, just with more states than usual to cover
//    each blocking piece individually:
//     - `Intro_TPIPE()`'s own blocking blink-and-wait-for-press-then-
//       release loop -> TPIPE_STATE_INTRO_WAIT.
//     - `FADE_TPIPE()` (a real 9-step screen-wide fade transition, each
//       step a real `_delay_ms(20)`) -> a shared `tpipeAdvanceFade()`
//       helper (one step per real engine frame, not per 20ms - the
//       whole transition was already only ~180ms real time upstream, so
//       this is a close, imperceptible-difference match) reused by every
//       fade-in/fade-out call site via its own dedicated state.
//     - `NEXT_LEVEL_TPIPE()`'s own two `_delay_ms(250)` calls (bracketing
//       the level-number digit draw and the level-start music) ->
//       TPIPE_STATE_LEVEL_LOAD_WAIT1/2, plain frame countdowns.
//  - `SND_TPIPE(1)` (played when the player dies) is a genuinely
//    startling find: a *nested* loop (`for(e=0;e<100;e+=20){for(r=e;
//    r<e+100;r++){Sound(255-r,2);}}`) firing **~500** `Sound()` calls
//    synchronously in one go - the largest computed sweep found in this
//    project yet (bigger than Tiny Missile's 508-note sweeps, in the same
//    ballpark). Same root cause and fix as every other one of these
//    (Tiny Arena's death sweep, Tiny Missile's win/lose sweeps): harmless
//    on real AVR hardware (each call blocks for a a fraction of a
//    millisecond, so ~500 calls still finish in well under a second) but
//    Vircon32's async audio channel has no queue, so synchronous calls
//    with no real time between them would only ever be *heard* as the
//    last call's tone. Converted proactively, before ever compiling, to
//    a small frame-stepped, downsampled descending sweep (~15 notes,
//    step -12) - preserves the audible "warble down" character without
//    reproducing the literal overlapping-block structure or the note
//    count.
//  - `switch`/`case` avoided proactively (matching Tiny Doc/Bike's own
//    established caution, never yet tested in this dialect) -
//    `SND_TPIPE`'s dispatch, `LOAD_LEVEL_TPIPE`'s multi-case fall-through
//    bonus-life levels (2/5/8/11/14/17, rewritten as one `||`-chained
//    `if`), `INVERT_TURTLE_TPIPE`'s dispatch, and the main loop's
//    `GP.STATE` dispatch are all `if`/`else if` chains instead.
//    `SND_TPIPE`'s own case 4 is never actually called from anywhere in
//    the source - confirmed by grep before dropping it as dead code.
//  - Every intra-function `goto` used purely as a structured-control-flow
//    shortcut (a "continue" via `goto SKIPP_`, an "early exit past a
//    trailing cleanup line" via `goto EnD_`, etc.) was rewritten with
//    plain `if`/`else`/`continue` rather than porting the labels
//    verbatim - lower-risk than being the first port in this project to
//    test intra-function `goto`/label control flow (as opposed to the
//    already-proven outer-loop `goto NEWGAME:`-style state dispatch every
//    other port here already uses safely).
//  - `Trace_LINE`/`DIRECTION_LINE`/`Return_Full_Byte`/`RECONSTRUCT_BYTE`
//    (a Bresenham-style line-drawing primitive) and the `DEBOUNCE` macro
//    are declared in `ELECTROLIB.h` but never actually called anywhere
//    in the game logic - confirmed by grep before dropping them, the
//    same "provably dead, don't port verbatim" treatment as other finds
//    in this project (e.g. Tiny Bike's own dead-function cleanup).
//  - `Tiny_Flip_TPIPE()`'s own `FLIP_MODE_` parameter maps to a column
//    width of 128 (full) or 110 (partial) - but the *only* real call site
//    in the whole game (`Tiny_Flip_TPIPE(0)`, every real gameplay frame)
//    always resolves to the **110** case, meaning columns 110-127 (18 of
//    128) were *never* redrawn during actual play - the exact same "real
//    SSD1306 VRAM persistence" assumption already found and fixed in
//    Pinball/Doc/Bert/Trick, just newly discovered here rather than
//    retrofitted after a report. Fixed proactively: `tpipeTinyFlip()`
//    always redraws the full 128 columns.
//  - The above fix also exposed a genuine latent out-of-bounds risk in
//    the earthquake screen-shake effect (`x2 = (x>16) ? x+EARTQUAKE_INVERT
//    : x;`, in the original the shifted column could reach 128 for
//    x=127 - past `BACKGROUND_TPIPE[1024]`'s real bound of 127 within a
//    given row) - harmless on AVR's forgiving flat memory (reads one
//    byte into the next row/array), a real invalid-read risk on
//    Vircon32. Fixed with an explicit clamp to 127.
//  - `FADE_TPIPE()`'s own mask computation (`0xff << (8-l)` for fade-in,
//    `0xff << l` for fade-out) relies on AVR's implicit `uint8_t`
//    narrowing to keep the shifted value within a real byte - on
//    Vircon32's full-width `int` shifts, `0xff << 8` is `0xFF00`, not 0,
//    which would silently zero out every masked pixel (`wideMask &
//    byteValue` is always 0 when the mask's only set bits are above bit
//    7). Fixed with an explicit `& 0xFF` on the computed mask itself -
//    the same byte-truncation-reliant-trick class of bug as Tiny Arena's
//    VSlide fix, just caught here by inspection before ever compiling
//    rather than via a runtime crash.
//  - **Frame-pacing, added later by direct request**: upstream itself has
//    no genuine real-time throttle at all (the "no timing model" category,
//    same as Trick/Invaders/Pinball/Bert/Tris/Arkanoid), so this game
//    originally shipped running at Vircon32's native 60fps throughout.
//    Capped to 30fps, including its own logic (not just the redraw), via
//    a whole-function `TPIPE_TICK_DIVISOR=2` tick-skip gating the entire
//    top of `gameTinyPipe_update()` - the same shape already used for
//    NumberPlace/HollowSeeker/t2048/Doc/Pacman (not the movement-only/
//    redraw-stays-60fps shape used for Trick/Invaders/Pinball/Bert).
//    Every existing tick-counted wait constant in this file
//    (`tpipeWaitFrames`, `tpipeIntroBlinkT`, the fade-step counters) is
//    left unrescaled, matching this project's own standing "one divisor,
//    no dual bookkeeping" practice - they simply now take twice as long
//    in real time, which is the intended effect of halving the tick rate.

// documented over-budget failure mode). Root cause: the player and all 4
// turtles were each composited via a full per-pixel call
// (`tpipeMainBlitz`/`tpipeSpritesTurtle`, called once per one of 1024
// pixels/frame, with the turtle version additionally looping over all 4
// sprites internally every single call) - the same O(pixels x objects)
// shape already found and fixed in Bomber/Pacman/Bert/Doc. Fixed the same
// way: composite each sprite once per *page row* (8 times/frame) into a
// shared buffer, over only its own real column footprint, rather than
// scanning all 128 columns per sprite.
//
// The row-membership check below (`recupeLineY <= y <= recupeLineY+1`)
// is not an approximation of the original per-pixel gate - it's the
// exact same range `tpipeBlitzSprite()` already checks internally (its
// own HSPRITE field is 1 for both sprites here, so it can only ever
// produce a nonzero result within that 2-row span regardless of what
// gate calls it) - so this cuts wasted calls without changing output,
// the same "self-gating still costs a full call every time it's
// invoked" lesson already applied elsewhere in this project.

// one-shot "prepare next value" pattern, not a bug. But `tpipeGP.digit1/2`

// forced redraw (see gameTinyPipe_forceRedraw()) could fire during
// TPIPE_STATE_LEVEL_LOAD_MUSIC/WAIT2 - reading them live there redraws
// the wrong ("02" instead of the still-on-screen "01") digits. Fixed by
// freezing what was actually just drawn into its own pair of globals,
// used by every redraw (real or forced) instead of the live, already-
// advanced GP fields.
