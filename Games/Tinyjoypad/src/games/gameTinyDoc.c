// =============================================================================
// Tiny Doc - ported from Daniel C's Tiny-Doc.ino (tinyjoypad.com, GPLv3).
// Same tinyJoypadShim lineage as Tiny Invaders/Pinball/Pacman/Bomber
// (FastTinyDriver.h) - button reads reuse that shim as-is. A Dr. Mario-style
// falling-pill puzzle game: two-cell "pills" fall into an 8x10 grid, matching
// runs of >=4 same-colored cells (pill halves or viruses) clear, and clearing
// every virus advances the level.
//
// Button mapping: same ELECTROLIB.h analogRead(A0)/(A3)+digitalRead(1)
// pattern as gameTinyPinball.c/gameTinyBomber.c - TINYJOYPAD_LEFT/RIGHT off
// A0, TINYJOYPAD_DOWN off A3 (no UP used - this game only needs left/right/
// soft-drop), BUTTON_DOWN off digitalRead(1) (rotate). All map directly onto
// isLeftPressed()/isRightPressed()/isDownPressed()/isFirePressed().
//
// Structural changes from upstream:
//  - upstream's loop() is NEWGAME:/NextLevel_TD: labels around nested
//    while(1)s - rewritten as an explicit frame-stepped state machine, same
//    approach as every other tinyJoypadShim port here.
//  - the line-clear/gravity cascade (`do { CheckCompletedLine_TD(); } while
//    (DropPills_TD());`, plus ClearLine_TD()'s own 6-frame clear-animation
//    loop) was a *blocking* multi-frame sequence upstream (each iteration
//    calls TinyFlip_TD()+FPS_Count_TD() itself). Rewritten as an explicit
//    `tdResolveState` sub-state machine (SCAN -> CLEAR_ANIM -> DROP -> loop
//    back to SCAN if anything moved, else resume normal play) that advances
//    one step per real engine frame instead of looping to completion inside
//    a single frame.
//  - dropped the real-time `_delay_ms()`/`FPS_Count_TD()` frame limiter
//    throughout - an early revision of this port just relied on the
//    engine's own 60fps `end_frame()` pacing instead, but a later frame-
//    pacing session (see CLAUDE.md) added a real tick-skip throttle
//    (`TD_TICK_DIVISOR`) so this file's own update() actually reproduces
//    upstream's real ~30fps rate again, same as `FPS_Count_TD()` did. The
//    two meaningful (non-limiter) delays - a ~1000ms pause after a level
//    first appears, and a ~2000ms pause after game over - became explicit
//    `tdWaitFrames` counts, halved (30/60) when the throttle above was
//    added so both keep measuring the same real-world duration they
//    always did, not double it.
//  - `uint8_t` is aliased to plain `int` via avrCompat.h (as for every other
//    port), which breaks one *intentional* upstream trick: `DropPills_TD()`
//    counts `for (uint8_t y = 8; y < 255; y--)`, relying on `y` underflowing
//    from 0 to 255 to end the loop. A real (non-wrapping) `int` would make
//    that condition true forever. Rewritten as a plain signed
//    `for (int y = 8; y >= 0; y--)`.
//  - GCC's `case N ... M:` case-range extension (used by
//    `ReturnScanLineX_TD()`'s column lookup and `SwitchRecupVirus_TD()`) and
//    `switch` itself aren't used anywhere else in this project's ports, so
//    rewritten as plain `if`/`else if` chains rather than risk relying on
//    dialect support that's never been exercised before.
//  - `rand() % n` -> the shared `arand(n)` helper (avrCompat.h), same fix as
//    every other port here.
//  - `SND_TDOC_TD()`'s two real-time tone-sweep cases (a 13-iteration two-
//    tone loop for level-clear, a ~190-iteration descending sweep for game
//    over) are approximated with a handful of representative `Sound()`
//    calls, same simplification already used for Tiny Invaders/Bomber's own
//    busy-wait sound effects.
//  - render loop (`tdTinyFlip`) was written from the start with the row/x-
//    range gating lesson learned from this session's Tiny Invaders/Bomber
//    CPU-load optimization pass (each of the 7 draw layers only ever
//    applies to a narrow, already-known x/y sub-range - gated in the outer
//    loop instead of calling every layer unconditionally on all 1024
//    pixels/frame).

// The locked-grid composite (tdCompositeTabIntoBuffer(), see its own

// filled, but the grid itself is static on almost every frame - it only
// actually changes when a pill locks, a line-clear/drop cascade is
// running, or a new level is set up. Every *other* frame (most frames - a
// pill just falling/moving, or the grid sitting untouched) was still

// every frame - exactly the "grid is almost full -> slows down a lot"
// cost the user reported.
//
// `tdPageRowDirty[y]` (one flag per page row, 1..7 used) is set wherever a
// grid-mutating function runs; tdTinyFlip() only recomputes a given page
// row's composite (tdCompositeTabIntoBuffer(y)) when that row's own flag is
// set, reusing the cached `tdTabCache` (a plain array read, no
// blitzSprite calls at all) otherwise. Most mutation sites
// (tdSetSinglePill/tdInitRnd/tdDropPills/tdInitPublicVarForNewLevel, the
// inline clear-animation/virus-anim ticks in gameTinyDoc_update()) touch an
// unpredictable/whole-grid range and mark every row dirty via
// tdMarkAllRowsDirty() - safe, same cost as before. tdFixPill() - by far
// the single most frequent mutation during real play, one call per pill
// lock - writes exactly 1-2 known grid cells, so it marks only the
// specific page row(s) that actually cover them via tdMarkGridRowDirty(),
// leaving the other 5-6 rows' cache untouched. This mattered in practice:
// under a stress test with the board pre-filled near-full and pills
// locking rapidly, CPU load was pegged at 100% almost continuously (each
// lock forcing a full 7-page-row recompute over the dense board) even
// though the existing whole-grid dirty flag was already working exactly
// as designed - narrowing the invalidation scope to the row(s) that
// actually changed is what cuts the sustained cost, not a bug fix.

// harmless on real AVR hardware (each Sound() call genuinely blocks), but
// md_playTone() (which Sound() itself calls into) has no queue: a burst
// of N calls with no real time between them is only ever audible as the
// very last one. Fixed with a small non-blocking byte-pair sequencer,
// same shape as this project's other ports (gameTinyPacman.c etc) - it
// still calls the shared Sound(freqByte,durByte) directly (not
// md_playTone()), so no formula re-derivation is needed here, just
// correct timing between calls. This file's own gameTinyDoc_update() only
// ticks once every TD_TICK_DIVISOR(2) real frames (30 logic ticks/sec),
// so wait-frame counts below are computed against 30, not 60.
