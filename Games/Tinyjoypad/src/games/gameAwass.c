// AWASS mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, license "None specified" -
// GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_awass`) - a platformer: climb
// ladders/walk floors on a 12-column x 4-floor stage collecting all 8 flags
// (4 matching pairs) while dodging chasing monsters; press Fire to scroll the
// nearest floor left/right (reconnecting its ladders to a different column),
// a mechanic this port's own menu credits as its distinguishing feature over
// the already-shipped sibling port Cracky (same author/engine, no floor-
// scroll mechanic there). 8 hand-authored stages, cycled indefinitely with a
// rising difficulty ramp (MaxTime shrinks every full cycle through all 8),
// 3 lives, real persistent hi-score tracked in-session (upstream has no
// EEPROM at all - a CH32V003 RISC-V microcontroller, not AVR, so this
// project's own `eeprom_*` shim/avrCompat widening aren't relevant here the
// way they are for every ATtiny85 port - same situation as Cracky's own).
//
// Ported following gameCracky.c's own proven methodology exactly (same
// engine/"Cate" framework, same author) - see that file's own header for the
// fuller rationale behind each technique reused here rather than re-derived:
// real SSD1306 display streamed one raw byte at a time (`SendOledData()`, no
// framebuffer - the same model `md_drawColumn()` already handles), a real
// explicit 60Hz SysTick-based frame limiter (`Timer.cpp`'s own `kTimerHz=60`,
// `WaitTimer(t)`), and only 4 directions + 1 action button
// (`ScanKeys.h`'s own `Keys_Button0`) - a strict subset of what
// `tinyJoypadShim.h` already exposes (`isFire2Pressed()` unused here, same as
// Cracky).
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform, confirmed correct from the
// start rather than needing Cracky's own multi-attempt trial-and-error**:
// `Oled.cpp`'s `InitOled()` sends the identical `OledCmd::RightToLeft`/
// `OledCmd::BottomToTop` (SegRemap=0xA1/ComScanDec=0xC8) pair Cracky's own
// header already documents as a real-hardware panel-mounting compensation
// with no equivalent to correct for in a software recreation - per this
// task's own explicit instruction, no mirror/reversal/lookup-table transform
// was ever written. `awaComposeRawByte(col,page)` is drawn directly at its
// own `(col,page)`.
//
// **Rendering differs from Cracky in one structural way worth documenting**:
// upstream keeps TWO VVram buffers (`VVramBack` - the persistent map layer,
// only ever touched by *incremental* patches: `InitTrying()`'s one-time full
// draw, `MoveFloor()`'s own per-floor-being-scrolled rewrite, and single-cell
// patches from `HitFlags()`/`EraseBomb()` - plus `VVramFront`, rebuilt from
// Back via a full `memcpy` then overlaid with sprites, fresh every
// `DrawAll()`). This port collapses both into one buffer (`awaVVram`,
// matching Cracky's own single-buffer model) rebuilt **entirely from
// `awaStageMap[]`** (the canonical cell data) every single frame, rather than
// replicating `VVramBack`'s own incremental-patch persistence - the same
// "always redraw the full frame from source-of-truth state, don't replicate
// a VRAM-persistence trick" standing precedent Cracky's own header already
// established. This is a strictly safer simplification here than it might
// first look: every incremental `VVramBack` write upstream performs
// (`DrawFloor`/`DrawFloorShift`/`VErase2XY`/`VPut2CXY`) is itself a *pure
// function* of `awaStageMap`'s current content (plus, for the floor actively
// mid-scroll, which of the two `DrawFloorShift` half-steps is due) - nothing
// upstream ever draws depends on any state that ISN'T already recoverable
// from `awaStageMap` + a small number of explicit scroll/blink state
// variables, so a full rebuild from that same state every frame reproduces
// every real visible frame exactly. Sprite draw order (see `Sprite.cpp`'s own
// `DrawSprites()`, which composites in *reverse* index order - Man drawn
// first/lowest-priority, Monsters next, Bangs next, Points drawn last/on-top)
// is preserved via the same descending-index composite loop.
//
// **The floor-scroll animation's own two-step, direction-asymmetric sequence
// was traced through by hand before ever writing code, not simplified** -
// `MoveFloor()`'s `switch(Scrolling)` does the roll-then-draw in a DIFFERENT
// order for left (-1/-2: shift-draw with the OLD unrolled map, THEN roll one
// tick later) vs right (1/2: roll immediately, THEN shift-draw with the
// ALREADY-rolled map) scroll direction - reproduced literally as 4 distinct
// state values (not collapsed to a symmetric 2-state model), since the two
// directions genuinely differ in which tick the real `RollLeft`/`RollRight`
// mutation happens relative to the "shifted" animation frame. `DrawFloorShift`
// itself (`awaDrawFloorShiftInto()`) is a direct structural mirror of
// upstream's own pointer-walking function (the "faithfully copy an intricate
// stateful algorithm's own shape" precedent Cracky's own VVramToVram
// translation and Frogger's row-buffer compositing both already established
// in this project) rather than an attempt to re-derive a closed form: the
// map's own column-0 cell gets split across both screen edges (its "right"
// glyph pinned at column 0, its "left" glyph wrapped to the far right edge)
// while every other column renders normally, exactly matching
// `DrawCell`/`DrawCellLeft`/`DrawCellRight`'s own selective-half-glyph
// behavior.
//
// **A genuine, load-bearing real-time-cadence quirk in upstream's own outer
// loop, worked through by hand rather than assumed benign** - `Main.cpp`'s
// `do{...}while(FlagCount!=0)` body only calls `WaitTimer(8)` (a real ~133ms
// delay) when `(Clock&3)==0`; `MoveFloor()` itself is called on *every*
// iteration regardless. Since the 3 non-waiting iterations between each real
// wait execute with zero elapsed real time (nothing gates them), and
// `MoveFloor()`'s own internal gate (`(ScrollingClock&CoordMask)==0`) is
// *always true* in this degenerate `CoordRate=1` build (`CoordMask=0`), a
// full trace of the call sequence around an ACT-button press confirms only
// TWO real, distinct visible frames of scroll animation ever occur (the
// "shift" frame on the SAME gated tick the button press is read, then the
// "settled" frame exactly one gated tick later) - the extra "free" MoveFloor
// calls either fire within the very same already-gated tick (immediately
// after `MoveMan()` sets `Scrolling`, before that tick's own `DrawAll()`) or
// complete the second scroll step during the very first zero-delay
// iteration, before the *next* gated tick's own draw, so no observable frame
// is ever skipped or duplicated. This means a plain single-call-per-gated-
// tick `awaMoveFloor()` (called once from the same `AWA_TICK_DIVISOR`-gated
// update every other tinyJoypadShim port here already uses) reproduces the
// real observable cadence exactly, with no special-casing needed - verified
// by this exact hand-trace, not assumed by analogy.
//
// **Class-shape**: upstream's `Movable`/`Actor` (`Man : Actor`, `Monster :
// Actor`) flatten into one `AwaActor` struct (x,y,sprite,status,dx,dy) -
// literally the same field layout as Cracky's own `CrkMovable`, just now
// genuinely shared by both Man and every Monster slot (Cracky's `CrkMovable`
// was similarly reused). `Man`'s own `pManDirection` (a pointer into a
// `static const Direction[4]` table, used as a "last successfully applied
// direction" sticky fallback exactly like Cracky's own
// `crkManOldDirDx/Dy/Pattern`) is ported as an index into a flat
// `int[4][4] awaManDirTable` instead of a pointer-to-struct-array, avoiding
// an unproven pointer-into-array-of-struct pattern in this dialect. `Point`/
// `Bang` (`: Movable`) flatten into their own small structs the same way.
//
// **Sound**: same real 3-tone-channel software mixer as Cracky's own engine
// (`Sound.cpp`, `StartMelody()`/`WaitMelody()`), but `Tempo=150` here (not
// Cracky's 160) - `SoundHandler()`'s own tempo formula gives
// `awaNoteFrames(length) = round(length * (600/2)/150) = length * 2` exactly
// (a clean integer multiplier, no fractional rounding needed, unlike
// Cracky's own 1.875). Every call routes to `md_playTone()` directly, same
// as Cracky (this shim's own single-call `Sound(freq,dur)` AVR-buzzer model
// is too limited for a real multi-voice tracker); `md_playTone()` is already
// genuinely multi-voice project-wide (see this project's own CLAUDE.md), so
// the 3 independent sequencer slots (0=one-shot SFX, reused by
// Loose/Hit/Bang/Beep/Move exactly like Cracky's own channel-0 reuse;
// 1=jingle/BGM-voice-A, reused by Start/Clear/GameOver plus BGM voice A;
// 2=BGM-voice-B only) never fight over one shared channel. Melody data
// byte-diff-extracted via a small Python script (not hand-copied) - see
// `crkMelodyLength()`/`crkMelodyValue()`'s own established id-based resolver
// pattern, reused here unchanged in shape.
//
// **A real AVR-`byte`-wraparound-reliant helper, fixed rather than ported
// literally** - `Stage.cpp`'s own `TreatColumn()`:
// `if (column >= static_cast<byte>(-ColumnCount)) return column+ColumnCount;`
// relies on a negative `byte` (e.g. -1) wrapping to 244 (256-12) so the
// comparison catches it - the exact "AVR-implicit-narrow-type behavior the
// port can't assume holds" bug class this project's CLAUDE.md documents at
// length (byte-truncation/shift-wraparound/signed-sentinel/etc). Fixed with
// a genuine sign check (`if(column<0) return column+AWA_COLUMN_COUNT; if
// (column>=AWA_COLUMN_COUNT) return column-AWA_COLUMN_COUNT;`), safe since
// every real call site only ever offsets by exactly +/-1 (a single wrap step,
// matching upstream's own single-wrap-only design intent).
//
// **The flag-blink and mid-scroll-shift visual effects both needed a small
// persistent "which visual variant to render this frame" flag**, since this
// port's own render function is a pure read of current state rather than an
// incremental-patch target: `awaScrollShiftView` (set by `awaMoveFloor()`
// each gated tick, read by the map-builder to choose `DrawFloorShift`-style
// vs normal `DrawFloor`-style rendering for `awaScrollingFloor` only) and
// `awaFlagBlinkOn` (toggled every other gated tick, matching upstream's own
// `BlinkFlags()` being called from the `(Clock&7)==0` branch - i.e. once
// every 2 gated ticks - and toggling its own visibility each time it fires;
// read by the map-builder to blank out, rather than draw, any still-present
// flag whose type matches `LastType`). `Flag.cpp`'s own `DrawFlags()` (a
// full re-draw of every remaining flag, called once from `HitFlags()` after
// a flag is collected) needed no separate port at all - it exists purely to
// patch `VVramBack` back to a correct state after a single-cell erase, which
// this port's own "always rebuild everything from `awaStageMap`" model
// already guarantees for free.
//
// **Two genuinely dead upstream declarations, confirmed via grep before
// dropping rather than ported**: `Monster.h`'s own `HitMonster(Movable*)` is
// declared but never defined or called anywhere in the real source (only
// the actually-used `HitMonsters()` - no `s` - exists); `Status.cpp`'s own
// `PrintPerfect()` is defined but never called from `Main.cpp` or anywhere
// else. `Vram.cpp`'s own `Backup[]`/`InvalidateVramBackup()` (the real-
// hardware dirty-tracking optimization skipped unchanged bytes) is dropped
// entirely, matching Cracky's own identical precedent.
//
// =============================================================================
// A meticulous post-port verification pass, run separately from the initial
// port above (which was only ever compile-tested, never played) - found and
// fixed two real, severe rendering bugs, confirmed one subtle piece of the
// original port's own reasoning correct via a real hardware photo, and
// closed one minor audio-fidelity gap.
//
// **Bug 1 (severe, game-breaking): the whole stage map was never actually
// unpacked.** `awaInitTrying()` copied `awaStageBytes[awaStageIndex][i]`
// directly into `awaStageMap[i]` for `i` in `0..47` - but `awaStageBytes`
// only has 12 valid entries per stage row (`int[8][12]`), not 48! Upstream's
// real `InitTrying()` (Stage.cpp) doesn't store one byte per map cell at
// all - it stores 12 BIT-PACKED bytes per stage (3 bytes/floor row x 4
// floors), each byte holding 4 two-bit cell values that get unpacked with a
// real bit-shift loop (`cell = b & 0x03; ...; b >>= 2;`) into the true
// 48-entry map, with `Cell_Ladder`(2) expanding to both nibbles and
// `Cell_Bomb`(3) expanding to a bomb-over-floor pair. The ported version
// skipped this unpacking entirely and just read 4x too far into a 12-entry
// array row - for `i>=12` this reads out of bounds into whatever global
// data happens to sit after `awaStageBytes` in memory (subsequent stage
// rows, then past the end of the whole 96-int table), producing a
// completely garbage, unplayable map on every single "try". **Fixed** by
// porting the real unpacking loop verbatim into `awaInitTrying()` (a local
// `fl`/`g`/`k`/`byteIdx` block - `fl` instead of the more natural `floor`,
// since `floor` collides with this dialect's own built-in `floor()` math
// function and produced a genuine parser error, "invalid start of
// sentence", the first time it was tried). Verified by decoding stage 0's
// real map data in a standalone Python re-implementation of both the
// buggy-direct-copy and the corrected-unpacking versions, rendering both as
// images, and comparing against the real device photo bundled in this
// game's own upstream repo (`more games/UIAPduino_awass/rec.jpg`) - the
// corrected version is an extremely close match (same ladder/floor/flag
// layout, same relative proportions); confirmed again directly in-engine
// via Puppeteer after the fix, matching that same photo.
//
// **Bug 2 (severe, but title-screen-only): the entire title screen rendered
// in the wrong screen region.** Upstream's real `Title()` (Status.cpp)
// draws its "AWASS" logo, "MINI", "INUFUTO 2026", and "START"/"CONTINUE"
// text at ABSOLUTE VVram-column positions inside the MAP area (cols 0-95) -
// e.g. `PrintS(Vram + VramRowSize*7 + 12*VramStep, "INUFUTO 2026")`, no
// `LeftX` offset at all - genuinely different from `PrintStatus()`'s own
// text, which really is always `LeftX`(24)-relative and belongs in the
// status zone (cols 96-127). The initial port routed ALL of Title()'s text
// through `awaPrintC`/`awaPrintS` (which only ever write into
// `awaStatusChar`, visible solely in the status zone) - so the whole title
// screen rendered crammed into the right-hand status column, overlapping
// the SCORE/STAGE/TIME labels, while the actual map area sat completely
// blank. Confirmed this is the EXACT SAME bug, unnoticed until now, already
// shipped in the sibling Cracky port (`gameCracky.c`'s own
// `crkBeginTitle()`, checked directly against Cracky's real upstream
// Status.cpp) - out of scope to fix here (only `gameAwass.c` may be
// touched), but worth flagging for a future pass. Also found in the same
// investigation: the port's own title text was missing the "MINI" line
// entirely and the "2026" year suffix on "INUFUTO", both silently dropped
// when the text was first (mis-)transcribed. **Fixed** by adding a genuine
// second text grid, `awaMapTextChar[8][AWA_VVRAM_WIDTH]` (see its own
// declaration comment below) plus `awaPrintMapC`/`awaPrintMapS` write
// helpers and an `awaMapTextActive` flag consulted by
// `awaComposeRawByte()`'s existing map-area branch - the same "pattern
// index per (page,char-cell)" technique `awaStatusChar` already uses for
// the status zone, just covering the map area instead, active only during
// `AWA_STATE_TITLE` (cleared the instant gameplay begins, so the real map
// takes back over `awaVVram` immediately). All 5 text pieces now render at
// upstream's real absolute columns; the cursor toggle in `awaUpdateTitle()`
// was moved from status-zone col0 to map-area col8 (`ArrowX`) to match.
// Found via a real Puppeteer screenshot, not code inspection alone - a
// first glance at the rendered title screen made the bug obvious the
// moment it was actually looked at, though pinning down the *correct* fix
// needed reading Status.cpp's real column arithmetic directly. Verified
// via Puppeteer afterward: title screen renders correctly with all 5 text
// pieces in the map area, the cursor toggles correctly between "START"/
// "CONTINUE", and gameplay (launched from either selection) renders
// correctly with the map area handed back to the real game state.
//
// **Checked carefully and confirmed correct, not just assumed**: the
// floor-scroll animation's own direction-asymmetric two-step sequence
// (state -1/-2 for left, 1/2 for right) was re-traced by hand against
// `Main.cpp`'s real `(Clock&3)==0`-gated outer loop and confirmed to
// reproduce upstream's exact observable cadence (see this file's own
// earlier header section) - no change needed. The render pipeline's own
// page-to-VVram-row mapping (`awaComposeRawByte`: hardware page P reads
// VVram row-pair P directly, all 8 pages) was independently re-derived
// from a literal trace of `Vram.cpp`'s real `VVramToVram()`/`DrawAll()`
// call chain, which appeared on paper to only ever send 7 of 8 hardware
// pages (starting at page 1, leaving page 0 and VVram's last row-pair
// unsent) - but a from-scratch Python re-render of stage 0 using that
// literal 7-page/shifted interpretation, compared side-by-side against the
// real device photo, showed a clear MISMATCH (a blank top strip, a cropped
// bottom row), while the existing "all 8 pages, direct mapping" model
// already in the port matched the photo closely. Given the real hardware
// photo is the most authoritative evidence available, the existing
// mapping was left unchanged and trusted over the from-scratch source
// trace - worth revisiting if a future session can pin down the exact
// mechanism that reconciles this (possibly `ComScanDec`'s own real effect
// on physical page ordering, or a subtlety in the dirty-tracking `Backup[]`
// buffer this port's own model deliberately doesn't replicate - see this
// file's own header section on that).
//
// **Minor audio fidelity fix**: `awaStopBgm()` only stopped sequencer
// channels 1/2 (the two BGM voices), but upstream's real `StopBGM()`
// resets ALL 3 hardware tone channels, including channel 0 (the one-shot
// SFX channel) - meaning a still-playing one-shot cue (e.g. a Bang melody
// mid-flight right as the player dies) would upstream be cut off
// immediately, not left to keep playing into the next state. Fixed by
// adding `awaStopSeq(0)` alongside the existing channel-1/2 stops.
//
// **Verified end-to-end via a real isolated Puppeteer test instance**
// (own WebBuild copy, own HTTP port, cleaned up afterward): menu
// navigation to AWASS, the title screen (both fixes above), launching into
// gameplay, movement in all 4 directions, ladder climbing, a real flag
// pickup (SCORE correctly incrementing by 5), the floor-scroll/Fire
// mechanic (visibly reconnects the floor's ladders), and - via a
// temporary debug hook (`awaMaxTime` lowered from 90 to 4, fully reverted
// afterward, confirmed via grep) - the complete TIME UP -> LOSE_ANIM ->
// retry cycle three times over, correctly decrementing lives each time,
// ending in a correctly-rendered "GAME OVER" overlay and a clean return to
// a fresh title screen. Monster-collision death (the OTHER way to lose a
// life) was not independently forced this session - the state-machine
// code path is identical to the time-out path from `awaMan.status &
// AWA_MOVABLE_LIVE` onward (both call `awaBeginLose()`), already proven
// correct by the time-out test, so risk is low, but worth a direct check
// if anything looks off. A genuine level-clear (collecting all 8 flags)
// was also not independently forced - `awaBeginClearWait()`/
// `awaUpdateClearWait()`/`awaUpdateClearJingle()`/`awaUpdateBonusTally()`
// were verified via direct line-by-line comparison against upstream's own
// `Main.cpp` (matching exactly, including the real bonus-tally formula and
// the `AddScore(2)`-per-`BonusRate`-remaining loop), but not visually
// triggered - a full run collecting all 8 of a stage's flags was outside
// this session's own time budget.
//
// **Follow-up pass, prompted by Cracky's own real-hardware-photo-driven
// title-screen rewrite (see gameCracky.c's own header for the full story)**:
// re-verified this file's own two-grid title/status text architecture
// (`awaStatusChar`/`awaMapTextChar`, already split apart correctly BEFORE
// Cracky's own single-unified-grid fix even existed, from this file's own
// earlier, independent discovery of the identical LeftX-vs-map-column bug -
// see the header section above) column-by-column against upstream's real
// `Status.cpp`/`Title()` addressing, rather than assuming it already matched
// just because the *architecture* was already right. Every title-screen
// text piece (the "AWASS" logo substitute, "MINI", "INUFUTO 2026", "START"/
// "CONTINUE", the selection cursor) and every status label (SCORE/STAGE/
// TIME/lives) checked out exactly against upstream's own literal
// `VramRowSize`/`VramStep`/`LeftX` arithmetic - no missing/truncated/
// mispositioned text anywhere in that part.
//
// **One real, previously-shipped bug found, in `awaPrintScore()` specifically
// - not a leftover from the title-screen fix, a plain transcription slip in
// its own column arithmetic.** Upstream's `PrintScore()` writes at real
// column `LeftX+2`=26 (5 digits) then a trailing '0' right after, at
// `LeftX+7`=31. Since `awaStatusChar` stores offsets LOCAL to LeftX (0-7
// representing real columns 24-31 - see its own declaration comment), those
// should be local offsets 2 and 7 - but the code actually read
// `awaPrintNumber5(1, 2+2, awaScore)` (local offset 4) and
// `awaPrintC(1, 2+7, '0')` (local offset 9): both the wrong position (score
// shifted 2 columns right of upstream) AND out of `awaStatusChar`'s own real
// column bound (`int[8][8]`, valid indices 0-7) - offsets 8/9 don't crash
// (row-major aliasing lands them in `awaStatusChar[2][0]`/`[2][1]` instead,
// safely inside the array's total 64-int allocation) but silently splatter
// score digits into the otherwise-blank status page 2 instead of rendering
// the score where it belongs. Found by re-deriving upstream's real column
// math directly rather than trusting the existing port's own arithmetic at
// face value. **Fixed** to the correct local offsets (2 and 7). Verified via
// a fresh isolated Puppeteer/WebGL instance: the title screen still renders
// identically to before (this bug only affects the in-game SCORE readout,
// never shown on the title screen itself, so no title-screen regression
// risk), and live gameplay now shows the SCORE digits at their correct
// on-screen position (immediately after the "SCORE" label, same row) with
// no stray characters on the page-2 status row above it.
//
// **A second, related architectural fix, applied after the identical issue
// was found and fixed in the reference port `gameCracky.c`**: the "AWASS"
// title WORD itself (as opposed to "MINI"/"START"/"CONTINUE"/the credit
// line, all genuinely plain text upstream too) had been simplified from
// upstream's own real pixel-art bitmap logo (`Status.cpp`'s `Title()`,
// `TitleBytes[]` - the single largest, most prominent element on the whole
// title screen) down to small plain text - the exact same wrong "purely
// decorative" judgment call independently made, and later corrected, in
// Cracky's own `crkBeginTitle()` (see that file's own header for the real-
// hardware-photo story that overturned it there). **Fixed** by adding
// `awaTitleBytes[80]` (byte-diff-verified against upstream's real
// `TitleBytes[]`, 5 letters x 16 values each) and drawing it directly into
// `awaVVram` at its own real position (VVram rows 2-5 / real hardware pages
// 1-2, with `TitleLeft=(24-4*5)/2=2` columns of left margin - unlike
// Cracky's own 6-letter title, whose `TitleLeft` happens to compute to 0),
// instead of the earlier plain-text substitute. `awaComposeRawByte()`'s
// map-area branch was restructured to OR-combine this `awaVVram` logo
// content with `awaMapTextChar`'s own text layer instead of choosing one
// exclusively - safe by construction, since the logo occupies only pages
// 1-2 while every text piece sits on pages 3/5/6/7, so the two can never
// both be non-zero for the same (col,page); outside the title screen
// (`awaMapTextActive` false), only the map layer is ever read, exactly as
// before this change, so real gameplay rendering is untouched. Verified via
// a compile-only check (`compile src/main.c`, a clean "global variables"
// success line with no errors) per this task's own explicit instruction not
// to play-test - not re-verified live in the emulator.

// direct inspection while auditing this file for the same shape, not yet
// reported live. Upstream's own `InRange()` (`Movable.cpp`) takes `column`/
// `row` as real `byte` locals: `byte column = (pMovable->x >>
// ColumnCoordShift) + dx;` - when a monster sits at column 0 and is offered
// `dx=-1` (one of `DecideDirection()`'s own 4 candidate directions,
// `Monster.cpp:96-121`, tried whenever the monster's normal `CanMove()`
// check just failed and its "Throgh"/phase-through-walls state is active),
// that addition wraps a real AVR byte to 255, and the very next line's own
// `column >= ColumnCount` check correctly catches it and returns false -
// exactly the "off the left/top edge" result upstream relies on the
// wraparound to detect. This port's `column`/`row` are plain, non-wrapping
// signed ints (per `avrCompat.h`'s own widening convention), so the same
// dx=-1-at-column-0 case (and the equivalent dy=-1-at-row-0 case for the
// row check below) instead leaves `column`/`row` genuinely negative -
// `column >= AWA_COLUMN_COUNT` never fires, and a negative `row` is always
// `< AWA_ROW_COUNT - 1` too, so both halves of this function would
// silently report "in range" instead of "off the edge". In play this would
// let a "Throgh" monster phase straight off the left/top edge of the map
// the instant it's standing on the boundary column/row and every normal
// direction is blocked - `DecideDirection()` would set `pMonster->dx`/`dy`
// to walk it there, and its own coordinate would then keep going further
// negative every tick, matching the same "silently wanders off the intended
// edge, potentially reappearing elsewhere via unrelated downstream
// coordinate math with no negative guard of its own" symptom class already

    // made for its own "CRACKY" logo, later corrected there after a real
    // user-supplied hardware photo proved that reasoning wrong (see that

    // the real bitmap (awaTitleBytes[], byte-diff-verified against upstream)
    // is drawn directly into awaVVram at its own real position (VVram rows
    // 2-5, i.e. real hardware pages 1-2 under this port's own `page =
