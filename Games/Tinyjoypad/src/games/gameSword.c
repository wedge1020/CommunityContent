// =============================================================================
// SWORD mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+CH32V003+SSD1306 "Cate engine" edition,
// repo "SwordWork", license "None specified" - GitHub reports no LICENSE
// file). A top-down action game on a 12-column x 7-row grid: walk around
// with the d-pad, swing a sword with Fire to knock out chasing monsters
// (killing one drops a score-popup and briefly respawns it from its own
// start point after a countdown - monsters are a persistent "wave", not a
// one-shot kill list), dodge vertically-bouncing balls, grab items to
// extend the sword's own reach (thrust distance), and collect every
// treasure box to clear the stage; 3 lives, real (session-only) hi-score.
//
// Same author/engine lineage as this project's own already-shipped
// gameCracky.c (near-identical VVram/Vram/Sound/Math/ScanKeys plumbing,
// down to a shared real upstream typo - see swdDecideDirection() below) -
// this port follows gameCracky.c's own already-proven structural patterns
// throughout: class-flattened C structs + prefixed free functions, a
// frame-stepped state machine replacing every blocking upstream
// `WaitTimer`/`WaitMelody` busy-wait, and the exact same two-level VVram
// (24x16 glyph-index grid) -> raw-byte nibble-packed composite technique.
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform is needed, matching
// Cracky's own final, hard-won conclusion** (see that file's own header
// comment for the multi-round debugging saga that established this) -
// `swdComposeRawByte(col,page)` is drawn directly at its own (col,page)
// via a plain `md_drawColumn()` loop, no column mirroring, no page
// reversal, no bit-reversal.
//
// **Coordinate model**: `GridCoordShift=1` (`GridCoordRate=2`) means every
// grid cell is exactly 2 "sub-units" wide/tall, and - just like Cracky -
// those sub-units are already expressed directly in VVram-cell-grid units
// (`ColumnWidth=2`/`RowHeight=2` VVram cells per grid cell), so sprite
// positions (`Man.x/y`, `Monster.x/y`, etc) plot directly into
// `swdVVram[y][x]` with no extra scaling. `CoordShift=0` (`CoordRate=1`,
// `CoordMask=0`) is a genuinely degenerate upstream parameterization here
// (every `& CoordMask` check upstream is unconditionally true, and a
// `Clock`-gated `(Clock & CoordMask) == 0` check in both Man.cpp and
// Monster.cpp is therefore *always* true too) - the `& CoordMask`
// comparisons are kept as literal expressions at their real call sites
// (matching this whole project's own "keep a degenerate-but-still-present
// upstream formula as a real expression" precedent, e.g. Cracky's own
// `CRK_COORD_RATE`), but the two `Clock` bookkeeping variables that only
// ever fed those permanently-true checks (Man.cpp's own local `clock`,
// Monster.cpp's own file-scope `Clock`) have no observable effect at all
// and were dropped rather than ported as genuinely inert complexity.
//
// **A real AVR/embedded-`byte`-wraparound-reliance bug, fixed proactively
// before ever compiling** - the same bug family this whole project has
// hit repeatedly (byte truncation, shift wraparound, signed sentinels,
// `int8_t` overflow reliance): both `CanMove()` (Man.cpp) and
// `CanMoveEnemy()` (Enemy.cpp) compute `byte nextColumn = (x >>
// GridCoordShift) + dx;` then only check `nextColumn >= ColumnCount` -
// relying on a *negative* result silently wrapping to a large unsigned
// value (0-1 -> 255 on a real `uint8_t`) to be caught by that same upper-
// bound check. Vircon32 ints don't wrap at 8 bits, so a leftward move at
// column 0 (or an upward move at row 0) would otherwise pass this check
// as a small negative number and read/write out of the intended grid.
// Fixed with an explicit `< 0` guard at both sites (`swdCanMove()`,
// `swdCanMoveMonster()`/`swdCanMoveBall()`). `Movable.cpp`'s own
// `NextCell()` has the identical wraparound-reliant shape but is
// confirmed dead code (declared, never called anywhere in the real
// source) and was dropped entirely rather than ported.
//
// **Sound**: `Sound.cpp` is the exact same real 3-tone-channel software
// mixer as Cracky's own, just with `Tempo=180` instead of Cracky's 160 -
// every `Sound_X()` one-shot effect and the two-part BGM route through
// the identical `[length,note]` byte-pair melody format, and this port
// reuses Cracky's own already-proven 3-voice frame-stepped sequencer
// shape verbatim (0=one-shot SFX, 1=jingle/BGM-voice-A reused, 2=BGM-
// voice-B), just re-derived for this file's own real tempo:
// `SoundHandler()`'s tick math is `time -= Tempo; if (time<=0) { time +=
// 300; advance(); }`, so one melody "length" unit = `300/Tempo` real
// 60Hz ticks - `swdNoteFrames(length) = round(length * 300/180)` =
// `round(length * 1.66667)` (vs. Cracky's own `*1.875` for its
// `Tempo=160`). Every melody's own `[length,note]` byte-pair table was
// byte-diff-extracted via a small Python script from the real upstream
// `Sound.cpp` (resolving its `NoteLength`/`Scale` enum symbols
// numerically first), not hand-transcribed - all 9 melodies (Loose/Hit/
// Up/Attack/Start/Clear/GameOver/Bgm1/Bgm2) checked against the script's
// own element counts before use.
//
// **The periodic "extra pause" in `Main.cpp`'s own tick loop, replicated
// rather than dropped as an odd upstream quirk**: `do { if ((Clock&3)==0)
// {...real logic...; WaitTimer(8);} if ((Clock&15)==0) {WaitTimer(8);}
// ...; ++Clock; } while(...)` - since real logic only ever runs on
// `Clock%4==0` iterations, and 16 is a multiple of 4, every 4th *active*
// logic tick also gets a second, doubled-length pause (no extra state
// change, just idle time) immediately after it. Reproduced with
// `swdActiveTickIndex` (a plain incrementing count of completed active
// ticks, checked `% 4 == 0` - equivalent to `Clock % 16 == 0` restricted
// to the already-`Clock%4==0` moments the real check can ever fire at)
// and, on that condition, seeding `swdTickCounter` at `-SWD_TICK_DIVISOR`
// instead of 0 so the next active tick needs a full 16 real frames
// instead of 8 - the same single-divisor-with-an-occasional-double-wait
// shape, no separate second timer to keep in sync.
//
// **Title screen's own text grid width - fixed after a real user-supplied
// hardware photo of Cracky (this project's other Cate-engine port)
// overturned the whole batch's original title-screen text model.** This
// port originally modeled `swdStatusChar` as an 8-char-wide grid (only
// ever wide enough for upstream's own status labels, SCORE/STAGE/REMAIN,
// which really are confined to upstream's own `LeftX=24`-based columns
// 24-31) and then ALSO tried to cram every piece of Title()'s own text
// ("SWORD", "MINI", "START"/"CONTINUE", the "INUFUTO 2026" credit) into
// that same narrow 8-cell slice - even though upstream's real `Title()`
// writes all of that text via the exact same `PrintS()`/`PrintC()`
// mechanism status text uses, just at genuinely different real columns
// (MINI at col 16, START/CONTINUE at col 9 with the cursor at col 8, the
// credit line at col 12 - see Status.cpp's own `Title()`), spanning the
// real full screen width (0-31 char cells), not a second narrow zone.
// **Fixed** the same way Cracky's own identical bug was fixed: widened
// `swdStatusChar` to `[8][32]`, added `swdFullWidthText` (true only while
// on the title screen) so `swdComposeRawByte()` reads the whole 32-column
// range instead of just the map area, and moved every status-label print
// call (SCORE/STAGE/REMAIN) onto upstream's own real, literal columns
// (LeftX=24-based) instead of a local 0-7 offset - see `swdStatusChar`'s
// own header comment and `swdComposeRawByte()`'s own comment for the full
// mechanism. Every title-screen string (MINI/START/CONTINUE/credit) now
// sits at upstream's own real literal columns, with nothing left needing
// to be trimmed, relocated, or dropped to fit.
//
// **A second, related architectural issue, found afterward and fixed the
// same way as Cracky's own identical fix**: the title's own decorative
// "SWORD" wordmark had initially been left as a plain-text substitute
// (this project's own 26-glyph font, `swdAsciiPattern` - " 0123456789>
// ACEFGIMNORSTUV", note no 'P' - is missing several common letters
// including W and D, so "SWORD" itself lost two of its own five letters
// to blank cells) rather than upstream's real hand-authored VVram bitmap
// logo - reasoned at the time as "purely decorative, not load-bearing."
// That reasoning was wrong, the same way it was wrong for Cracky: it's the
// single biggest, most prominent element on the whole title screen, not a
// throwaway detail, and a real user-supplied hardware photo of Cracky's
// own title screen (see that file's own header comment) is what actually
// established this. **Fixed** by restoring the real bitmap
// (`swdTitleBytes[]`, drawn directly into `swdVVram` by `swdBeginTitle()`)
// and OR-combining it with the status-text layer in
// `swdComposeRawByte()` instead of picking one exclusively - see both of
// those functions' own header comments for the full mechanism, including
// why Sword's own upstream `TitleBytes[]` data is laid out in a genuinely
// different (row-major, not letter-major) order than Cracky's.
// `PrintGameOver()`'s own real "GAME OVER" text (drawn
// directly into the *map* area, columns 32-67) is reproduced with the
// exact same small runtime overlay mechanism Cracky's own
// `PrintTimeUp`/`PrintGameOver` needed for the identical reason (no
// persistent VRAM here to lean on for a one-off direct write - see
// Cracky's own header comment for the fuller rationale) -
// `swdOverlayActive`/`Text`/`Len`/`Page`/`Col`, checked in `swdRender()`
// before falling back to `swdComposeRawByte()` - this overlay's own real
// upstream column (page 4, col 8) was already correct before this fix and
// needed no change.
//
// **The blocking upstream control flow converted to an explicit frame-
// stepped state machine**, the same treatment every port in this project
// needs: SWD_STATE_TITLE (`Title()`'s own key-poll loop), SWD_STATE_
// START_JINGLE (`Sound_Start()`'s real blocking wait, screen already
// showing the freshly-drawn stage), SWD_STATE_PLAYING (the tick-gated
// main loop described above), SWD_STATE_GAMEOVER_WAIT (the real
// `WaitTimer(30)` pause after `ShowMan()`/`DrawAll()`/`StopBGM()`),
// SWD_STATE_GAMEOVER_JINGLE (after `PrintGameOver()`'s overlay is set,
// `Sound_GameOver()`'s own blocking wait), SWD_STATE_CLEAR_WAIT (the
// mirror-image real `WaitTimer(30)` on a stage clear), and SWD_STATE_
// CLEAR_JINGLE (`Sound_Clear()`'s own blocking wait, followed by
// `++CurrentStage; goto stage;`). Unlike Cracky, Sword has no stage timer
// and no separate "lose animation" state at all - losing a life
// (`HitMan()`) is just a temporary-invincibility blink with no position
// reset and no freeze, so gameplay simply continues uninterrupted until
// `RemainCount` reaches 0.
//
// **Man<->Monster is a genuine two-way dependency** (Man's own attack
// swing calls `HitMonsters()`; a live Monster's/Ball's own movement calls
// `HitMan()`) - resolved without any forward declaration by ordering
// function *definitions* so `swdHitMan()` (which only ever touches Man's
// own state, never Monster's) is defined early, well before the Monster/
// Ball modules, while the rest of Man's own functions (`swdMoveMan()` in
// particular, which calls into Monster's `swdHitMonsters()`) are defined
// last, after Monster/Ball/Point/OneUp are all already in scope - a pure
// reordering of this file's own function layout, not a structural change
// from upstream's real Man.cpp/Monster.cpp split.
//
// Data extraction discipline matches this whole project's own established
// "byte-diff extract via script, don't hand-transcribe" practice
// throughout: `AsciiPattern`/`CharPattern` (Chars.cpp) and every one of
// the 8 stages' own start position / monster spawn list / ball spawn
// list / packed 21-byte wall-map (Stages.cpp) were all extracted via a
// small Python script parsing the real source files directly (resolving
// `(N<<4)|M`-style packed-byte expressions programmatically), not
// eyeballed by hand - each table's own element count checked against the
// script's own parse before use.
//
// **A follow-up meticulous verification pass** (this port had only ever
// been test-compiled, never played, before this pass) re-derived every
// data table via a fresh script-based byte-diff against the real upstream
// source (`AsciiPattern`/`CharPattern`/`Frequencies`/all 9 melodies/
// `RndNumbers`/every one of the 8 stages' own start-byte/monster-count/
// ball-count/monster-list/ball-list/21-byte wall-map - all confirmed
// byte-for-byte identical, no re-transcription needed), traced the whole
// state machine and every collision/movement function line-by-line
// against Main.cpp/Man.cpp/Monster.cpp/Ball.cpp/Enemy.cpp/Movable.cpp,
// and found + fixed 3 real bugs:
//
// 1) **A genuine, reachable-in-completely-ordinary-play out-of-bounds
//    array write**, the most severe finding of this pass.
//    `swdDrawSpritesIntoVVram()` was missing the bounds check upstream's
//    own `DrawSprites()` has (`y <= VVramHeight-1 && x <= VVramWidth-1`)
//    before ever writing a sprite's 2x2 block into `swdVVram`. Hand-traced
//    a full attack sequence tick-by-tick (concrete numbers, not just
//    reasoning) and confirmed the SWORD's own position is the one entity
//    in this whole file that ISN'T independently re-validated against the
//    grid boundary on every one of its own sub-steps - it just rides
//    exactly 1 grid cell ahead of Man, inheriting Man's own already-
//    validated per-step movement. Man is allowed to reach the very last
//    row/column while attacking (that's normal, valid movement), and at
//    that exact moment the sword sits far enough beyond it to land
//    outside the real 24x16 VVram grid - reachable with the default
//    starting `thrustCount=1` (no item pickups needed), attacking toward
//    any of the 4 edges from just inside it (e.g. column 10 of 0-11
//    facing right). Confirmed reachable on BOTH the positive side
//    (x/y > 23/15) and the negative side (attacking left/up near
//    column0/row0 drives the sword's own x/y genuinely negative) via the
//    same hand-trace. Upstream's own check only needs an upper bound
//    because a would-be-negative real AVR `byte` coordinate first wraps
//    to a large positive value (the exact same AVR-embedded-byte-
//    wraparound-reliance bug family already fixed once in this same file
//    for `swdCanMove()`/`swdCanMoveMonster()`/`swdCanMoveBall()`) -
//    Vircon32 ints don't wrap, so a literal port of upstream's own
//    upper-bound-only formula would have left the negative case
//    completely unguarded, an even worse out-of-bounds read/write
//    (before the start of the array) than the positive-side overrun.
//    Fixed with an explicit 4-sided range check (`x<0 || x>23 || y<0 ||
//    y>15`) before ever indexing into `swdVVram`. Without this, a sprite
//    write at x=24 would silently corrupt the next VVram row's own
//    column 0 (row-major array aliasing), and a write at y=16 would
//    corrupt whatever global sits right after `swdVVram` in memory - a
//    real, silent memory-corruption bug matching this project's own
//    well-documented "ERROR: INVALID MEMORY READ/WRITE" bug class,
//    reachable by simply attacking near any map edge, not a rare corner
//    case. Verified via an isolated Puppeteer test build: walked to and
//    attacked repeatedly at all 4 edges/both corners of stage 1 (which
//    starts the player right in the bottom-right corner), confirming no
//    crash and no visible rendering corruption anywhere on screen
//    throughout, plus a real game-over reached cleanly afterward (score
//    350, "GAME OVER" overlay rendered correctly) with the whole play
//    session remaining coherent start to finish.
//
// 2) & 3) **Two real "static-local-persists-across-goto" state-
//    progression deviations**, the same bug shape this file's own header
//    already documents once for the (inert) `Clock` variables, just
//    found in two places that DO have real observable effect. Main.cpp's
//    `static sbyte monsterNum = 0;` sits inside the goto-reachable
//    `stage:` block (re-entered on every new stage AND every new game) -
//    but real C++ semantics only run a static local's constant
//    initializer the very first time control ever reaches it; every
//    later `goto stage;` skips straight past that line, leaving
//    `monsterNum` to simply carry over whatever value the previous
//    stage's own monster-movement-throttle loop left it at, rather than
//    genuinely resetting to 0 every stage. Man.cpp's `static bool keyOn;`
//    (inside `MoveMan()`, no initializer at all) has the identical shape
//    - implicitly zero-initialized once at real cold boot, and never
//    touched by `InitMan()` on any subsequent stage, so whether Fire was
//    already held at the moment one stage/game ended genuinely carries
//    into the next one (blocking an instant re-attack if so). An earlier
//    version of this port reset both (`swdMonsterNum=0` in
//    `swdBeginStage()`, `swdManKeyOn=false` in `swdInitMan()`) on every
//    single stage transition, silently diverging from upstream's real
//    one-time-only semantics - a subtle but genuine deviation (a
//    slightly different monster-movement-throttle phase per stage; Fire
//    no longer needing to be released+re-pressed across a stage/game
//    boundary the way it really does upstream). **Fixed** by moving both
//    resets to run only once, in `gameSword_init()` (mirroring the real
//    program's own one-time cold-boot init, matching every other
//    genuinely-once-only reset already there like `swdHiScore=0`) and
//    removing them from `swdBeginStage()`/`swdInitMan()` entirely.
//
// Everything else traced during this pass held up as correct on
// re-derivation: `swdCanMoveMonster()`/`swdCanMoveBall()`'s own monster-
// vs-ball self-exclusion split (matches `CanMoveEnemy()`'s real pointer-
// identity behavior exactly, verified by tracing what a Monster-vs-Ball
// pointer comparison actually resolves to); `swdComposeRawByte()`'s own
// nibble-interleaved byte math (re-derived by hand against
// `VVramToVram()`/`SendUL()` byte-by-byte and confirmed an exact match,
// no mirroring/reversal needed, consistent with Cracky's own established
// conclusion); `swdPrintRemain()`'s icon-to-blank simplification (traced
// every RemainCount transition 1<->2<->3<->4+ by hand and confirmed the
// blank footprint always fully covers whatever a higher RemainCount's
// own display last touched, so no stale digit/icon can ever survive a
// transition); the GAME OVER vs CLEAR path's own different
// StopBgm/ShowMan/DrawAll ordering (a real, harmless upstream difference,
// reproduced faithfully rather than "normalized" to one order); and the
// `HideAllSprites()`/`NextCell()` call-site claims in this file's own
// original header comment (confirmed via a fresh grep: `HideAllSprites`
// really is only ever called from `Title()`, `NextCell` really is dead
// code, never called anywhere). Not independently re-forced this pass:
// a genuine stage-CLEAR (collecting every box on a level) - the state
// machine path for it is a direct structural mirror of the already-
// verified GAME OVER path (same wait/jingle/transition shape, just
// ending in `++CurrentStage; swdBeginStage();` instead of
// `swdBeginTitle();`), so risk is low, but worth a direct check if
// anything looks off.

// 24-31, 8 cells) - but Title()'s own text (the "SWORD" logo, "MINI",

// columns 0-23 (see Status.cpp's own `Title()`: MINI at col 16, START/
// CONTINUE at col 9 with the cursor at col 8, the credit line at col 12),
// using the exact same shared PrintC()/PrintS() mechanism at different
// column arguments - not a separate, narrower grid at all. Cramming all of
// that title-screen text into the same 8-cell-wide status grid (reusing
// columns 24-31 that the status labels ALSO use) is what caused this
// port's own version of the recurring bug pattern found across this

    // across the WHOLE 16-wide logo block (`repeat(LogoHeight){
    // repeat(LogoWidth){ pVVram=VPut(pVVram,*p); ++p; } pVVram +=
    // VVramWidth-LogoWidth; }` - LogoWidth spans all 4 letter-columns
    // before ever dropping to the next row) - confirmed directly from
    // upstream's own real loop shape before choosing this port's own loop
    // structure, not assumed identical to Cracky's just because both games
    // share the same engine. Reproduced with the matching row-major loop
    // below rather than Cracky's own letter-major one.

    // `swdComposeRawByte()` was updated to OR-combine this VVram content
    // with swdStatusChar's own text layer rather than choosing one
    // exclusively - see that function's own header comment for why this is
