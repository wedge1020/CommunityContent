// RUPTUS mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306/CH32V003 edition, license "None
// specified" - GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_ruptus`) - a
// Xevious/Cabal-flavored top-down shooter: an 8-directionally-rotating
// fighter continuously flies over a scrolling 48x64-cell world, shooting
// down enemy forts (each takes several hits) and dodging/destroying chasing
// enemies and their bullets. Destroy every fort on a stage to advance;
// barriers (destructible walls) block direct paths - shoot either end of a
// barrier to make it vanish. 10 hand-authored stages, 3 lives, real-time
// score, no time limit (unlike this project's own gameCracky.c sibling
// port). Session-only score tracking (upstream has no EEPROM at all - a
// CH32V003 RISC-V microcontroller, not AVR).
//
// Ported directly following gameCracky.c's own already-proven methodology
// (same author/hardware/driver lineage) rather than re-deriving one from
// scratch - see that file's own header comment for the shared reasoning on
// display orientation, the VVram two-level tile system, and the sound
// sequencer shape. This is the largest, most structurally involved port
// from this specific driver lineage so far: an 8-way rotating ship (vs.
// Cracky's 4-way platformer man), 4 concurrent bullet/enemy pools instead
// of Cracky's single monster list, a real bitmap minimap ("Rader"), and a
// genuinely pervasive reliance on real AVR-style `uint8_t`/`byte` wrap-
// around arithmetic for camera-relative coordinate math - see the
// "Byte-wraparound arithmetic" section of this comment for the single
// biggest correctness risk in this whole port and how it was handled.
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform needed, confirmed via the
// same real `InitOled()` register dump already found safe for Cracky**:
// `RightToLeft`/`BottomToTop` are sent here too, and per Cracky's own
// (user-verified) finding, these compensate for a physical panel-mount
// quirk on real hardware with no equivalent to correct for in software -
// the composed byte is drawn directly at its own (col,page), no mirror,
// no bit-reversal.
//
// **Rendering is three genuinely separate raw-byte regions sharing one
// 128-column x 8-page screen, derived by tracing the real upstream Vram
// addresses each subsystem writes to (not guessed):**
//   - **Map area, columns 0-103 (`VVramWidth`(26)*4)**: the same two-level
//     VVram-glyph-grid + `CharPattern` nibble-composite system as Cracky's
//     own `crkComposeRawByte()` - reproduced identically as
//     `rupComposeMapByte()`. **One genuine, deliberately-preserved upstream
//     quirk**: `VVramToVram()`'s own loop bound is
//     `VVramHeight/2 - 1 = 7`, not 8 - meaning real hardware only ever
//     streams the TOP 7 of 8 possible hardware pages from VVram; the
//     bottom 8px band of the play area (page 7, world rows 14-15 of the
//     16-row-tall viewport) is **never** drawn from the map data at all,
//     permanently black, on every stage, at every camera position (this
//     is not a rare edge case - with `StageHeight`(64) far taller than the
//     16-row viewport, the camera scrolls through this row range
//     constantly during normal play). Preserved faithfully rather than
//     "fixed" (matching this whole project's own "preserve odd-but-real
//     upstream behavior" precedent, and Cracky's own analogous choice for
//     its `Man.x < pMonster->y` comparison quirk) - `rupRender()` simply
//     never composes page 7 for columns < 104, leaving it whatever
//     `md_beginFrame()`'s own clear already left there (black), which is
//     the exact same real-hardware outcome with no extra code needed.
//   - **Status area, columns 104-127, pages 0-3**: `Status.cpp`'s own real
//     Vram addresses (`LeftX=26` chars = column 104, matching where the
//     map area ends exactly) - Score (page 0), Stage number (page 1),
//     Remain/lives (page 3, simplified from upstream's own 2x2 `Put2C`
//     icon to a plain digit, matching Cracky's own established
//     simplification for the identical situation). Page 2 is never
//     written by anything and stays black, matching upstream exactly.
//   - **Rader (minimap) area, columns 104-127, pages 4-7**: a genuinely
//     new subsystem for this driver lineage, not present in Cracky at
//     all - `Rader[]` stores real raw SSD1306 page-bytes directly (no
//     glyph lookup), composited via bit-level `&=`/`|=`/`^=` operations
//     (`DrawFortRader`/`DrawFighterOnRader`) rather than the tile system.
//     Ported as a literal `int[4][24]` byte grid (`rupRader`), streamed
//     straight to `md_drawColumn()` with no CharPattern/AsciiPattern
//     lookup needed at all, since each stored value already IS the final
//     hardware byte.
//
// **The Title() screen repurposes the WHOLE map-area pixel space (columns
// 0-103) as its own custom display** (its own real Vram addresses for
// START/CONTINUE/MINI/INUFUTO 2026 all land well inside the map column
// range, not the status column range) - since there's no game scene to
// show behind it, `rupRender()` OR-combines a `rupComposeMapByte()` pass
// (the real logo bitmap, see below - drawn directly into `rupVVram`) with
// a dedicated `rupComposeTitleByte()` pass (backed by its own
// `rupTitleChar[8][26]` grid, for MINI/START/CONTINUE/the credit line)
// for the whole map region, only while `rupState==RUP_STATE_TITLE`,
// leaving the status/rader areas rendered normally underneath (Title()
// really does call `PrintStatus()`/`ClearRader()` on real hardware too,
// so the score/stage/remain and an empty radar genuinely show on the
// title screen there as well).
//
// **A real bug, found and fixed the same way gameCracky.c's own sibling
// bug was**: upstream's own 80-byte hand-drawn "RUPTUS" pixel logo
// (`TitleBytes[]`, drawn straight into VVram via a `CharPattern`-glyph
// grid, not real text) was originally simplified to plain text "RUPTUS"
// here too, reasoning (incorrectly, per gameCracky.c's own later,
// user-photo-driven correction - see that file's own header comment and
// CLAUDE.md's "A real user-supplied hardware photo overturns Cracky's
// own title-screen design" section) that it was "purely decorative,
// non-gameplay-relevant." It isn't - it's the single largest, most
// prominent element on the whole title screen. **Restored**: the real
// `rupTitleBytes[]` table (byte-diff-verified against upstream via
// script) is now drawn directly into `rupVVram` by `rupBeginTitle()`, at
// upstream's own real position (`TitleLength=5`, `TitleLeft =
// (VVramWidth-4*TitleLength)/2 = 3`, VVram rows 2-5 -> real hardware
// pages 1-2 via `VVramToVram()`'s own row-pair packing), and
// `rupComposeMapByte()` composes it during the title screen the same way
// it already composes ordinary map tiles during gameplay - see
// `rupBeginTitle()`'s own comment for the full derivation. MINI and the
// credit line, previously deliberately repositioned (col10/col7) to suit
// the plain-text substitute's different shape, are now placed at
// upstream's own real, literal columns (18 and 12 respectively) since the
// real logo restores the shape those columns were originally tuned
// against - see `rupBeginTitle()`'s own comment for the exact derivation.
// START/CONTINUE (col `ArrowX+1`=9) were already correct and are
// unchanged.
//
// **Re-audited against gameCracky.c's own later, more serious title-screen
// grid-WIDTH bug fix** (a real user-supplied hardware photo proved
// Cracky's original `crkStatusChar[8][8]` was far too narrow, forcing
// "CONTINUE" to overflow and forcing MINI/the credit line to collide with
// the SCORE/STAGE/TIME status labels - see gameCracky.c's own header
// comment and CLAUDE.md's "A real user-supplied hardware photo overturns
// Cracky's own title-screen design" section for the full story). **This
// file does not share THAT bug and needed no equivalent structural
// fix** (a separate issue from the logo simplification above): unlike
// Cracky's design (one shared narrow grid, toggled between "status" and
// "full width" meaning via a flag), this port was written from the start
// with two entirely separate arrays - `rupStatusChar[4][6]` (bounds-
// checked to upstream's real status-only range, `LeftX=26` through 31)
// and `rupTitleChar[8][26]` (the *whole* real map-column range, 0-25) -
// so title text and status text can never physically collide or need a
// render-mode flag to disambiguate; see this comment's own "out-of-
// bounds-write risk... deliberately NOT repeated here" paragraph above,
// which already explains this was a deliberate design choice made with
// full knowledge of Cracky's narrower original mistake, not a later
// retrofit. Re-verified directly against real upstream columns (traced
// through `Status.cpp`'s `Title()`/`PrintStatus()` and `Vram.h`'s
// `VramStep=4`/`VramRowSize=0x100` constants) and via a fresh isolated
// Puppeteer/WebGL screenshot, before the logo restoration above: MINI/
// `>START`/CONTINUE (all 8 letters, not truncated)/INUFUTO 2026 all
// render fully, at non-overlapping columns, with the SCORE("00")/
// STAGE("I", the font's own correct thin-glyph rendering of digit '1')/
// REMAIN("R2") status text simultaneously visible and undisturbed on the
// right - and the "00"/"I" status rendering was independently cross-
// checked against this repo's own real-hardware photo (`rec.jpg`,
// in-gameplay rather than title, but showing the identical SCORE/STAGE
// glyph shapes at the same screen position), confirming this file's
// status-text placement already matches real hardware exactly.
//
// **A real, if minor, out-of-bounds-write risk found in Cracky's own
// title-screen text and deliberately NOT repeated here**: tracing
// `crkPrintS(6,1,sContinue,8)` (Cracky's own "CONTINUE" call) against its
// `crkStatusChar[8][8]` grid shows the 8th character of an 8-letter word
// starting at column 1 lands at column index 8 - one past that grid's own
// valid 0-7 range. Whether or not this is currently harmless on Cracky's
// own shipped build, this port's own title text also needs to show
// "CONTINUE" - rather than risk repeating an analogous overflow, `rupTitleChar`
// is sized `[8][26]` (a full map-width's worth of char-cells, comfortably
// oversized for every string this port ever writes into it - the longest,
// "INUFUTO 2026", is 12 characters) instead of a tightly-sized 8-wide grid,
// so no title-screen string can ever overflow it regardless of its own
// start column.
//
// **The `Sound.cpp` tone-sequencer system is structurally identical to
// Cracky's own** (3 `ToneChannel`s, the same `Tempo`-driven
// `(600/2)/Tempo` real-tick-cadence formula, the same `NoteLength`/`Scale`
// enum values, the same 40-entry `Frequencies` table byte-for-byte) - this
// game's own `Tempo` is 180, not Cracky's 160, giving
// `rupNoteFrames(length) = round(length * (300.0/180.0))` instead. Ported
// the same way: every `Melody()`/`WaitMelody()` call becomes a
// `rupStartSeq(channel, melodyId)` call into a shared 3-slot frame-stepped
// sequencer (0=one-shot SFX like Fire/Up, 1=jingle/BGM-voice-A, 2=BGM-
// voice-B), each melody resolved by id via `rupMelodyLength()`/
// `rupMelodyValue()` rather than a real pointer, matching Cracky's own
// "resolve by id" precedent. **A genuine EXTRA voice this game has that
// Cracky's didn't**: a real hardware noise/`EffectChannel` used for
// `Sound_SmallBang()`/`Sound_LargeBang()` (a decaying-volume noise burst,
// not a melody) - approximated as one direct `md_playTone(freqHz,
// durationSeconds)` call per bang (3000Hz small / 1500Hz large), with the
// duration derived from the real decay math (`MaxVolume`(63) decrementing
// by 2 every channel-advance tick until 0 = 32 steps, each
// `300/180=1.667` real ticks apart, at 60Hz = `32*1.6667/60 ≈ 0.889`
// real seconds) rather than reproducing a true decaying noise waveform
// this engine has no equivalent primitive for - the same "approximate a
// hardware feature with no direct portable equivalent" precedent already
// used elsewhere in this project (UFO's own thruster-hum approximation).
// **Two genuine upstream bugs found and fixed, not reproduced**:
// `Sound_Clear()`'s and `Sound_GameOver()`'s own `static const uint8_t
// notes[]` arrays have NO trailing terminator byte at all (every other
// melody in the file ends with an explicit `0`) - `ToneChannel::Next()`
// would read one element past the end of these two specific arrays once
// the melody finishes playing, a genuine out-of-bounds flash read on real
// hardware (harmless-looking there only because it silently reads
// whatever adjacent byte happens to sit in flash, not a documented
// terminator). Fixed by appending an explicit `0` to both melody tables
// in this port (`rupMelodyClear`/`rupMelodyGameOver`) rather than
// reproducing undefined behavior with no well-defined "faithful" result
// to copy in the first place.
//
// **Byte-wraparound arithmetic - the single biggest correctness risk in
// this whole port, handled far more pervasively than in any prior game in
// this project's own "AVR-implicit-narrow-type" bug family.** Nearly
// every coordinate in this game (`FighterX/Y`, `BaseX/Y`, every bullet/
// enemy/fort/barrier x/y) is a real `byte`(uint8_t)/`sbyte`(int8_t) field
// upstream, and several core algorithms **deliberately, load-bearingly
// rely on real 8-bit unsigned wraparound** to work at all - not just an
// incidental risk to guard against, the way most of this project's other
// byte-truncation fixes have been:
//   - `HitMover()`'s own collision test computes `xDiff`/`yDiff` as
//     `byte` values from a signed difference-plus-offset expression - the
//     classic "unsigned distance trick" (a genuinely far-apart pair wraps
//     to a huge byte value, safely failing the `< range` check, without
//     needing a separate `abs()`/sign check). Ported with an explicit
//     `rupWrapByte()` mask at each `xDiff`/`yDiff` computation - without
//     it, collision detection would silently misfire for any pair of
//     objects whose true difference happens to be negative before adding
//     the size offset (extremely common - this is called for essentially
//     every fighter/bullet/enemy/fort/barrier/item collision check in the
//     game).
//   - `AddX()`/`AddY()` (world-wraparound position stepping) and
//     `OffsetX()`/`OffsetY()` (camera-relative screen positioning) both
//     rely on a genuine double-wrap: the raw byte addition/subtraction
//     wraps through 0-255 first, and *only then* gets re-wrapped into the
//     真 game's own `[0,StageWidth)`/`[0,StageHeight)` range if needed. A
//     first draft of this port tried a "simplified" `AddX`/`AddY` that
//     skipped the intermediate byte-wrap (reasoning it'd be behaviorally
//     equivalent for the usual `dx` in `{-1,0,1}` case) - this is
//     correct for THAT case, but `StartEnemy()` also calls
//     `AddX(BaseX, VVramWidth)`/`AddY(BaseY, VVramHeight)` - passing the
//     *camera's own* possibly-"negative" (wrapped-byte) `BaseX`/`BaseY`
//     value as the base, with a much larger `dx`(26)/`dy`(16) - a case
//     where skipping the intermediate wrap gives a genuinely wrong
//     answer (traced by hand: `AddX(243/*≈-13*/, 26)` should give `13`,
//     but the simplified version gives `221`). Caught before ever
//     shipping by tracing this exact call site, not by a report - fixed
//     by properly replicating the real double-wrap via an explicit
//     `rupWrapByte()` at each step, matching upstream's literal
//     arithmetic instead of a "simplified but wrong for this one call
//     site" rewrite.
//   - `UpdateBasePosition()`'s own `BaseX = FighterX - VVramWidth/2` is
//     **itself** a deliberate wraparound: when the fighter is near the
//     world's left/top edge, `BaseX`/`BaseY` become large "wrapped-
//     negative" byte values on purpose - `OffsetX()`/`OffsetY()`'s own
//     `if (BaseX >= StageWidth) ...` branch specifically detects this
//     wrapped state to correctly offset on-screen positions near a wrap
//     seam. Ported with an explicit `rupWrapByte()` on the `BaseX`/`BaseY`
//     assignment itself, matching upstream's real semantic exactly rather
//     than trying to represent "camera can be conceptually negative"
//     any other way.
//   - Several `Locate()`-style sprite-visibility functions (Enemy, Item,
//     Bang) compute `x -= HalfSize` on an already-bounds-checked `byte`
//     local, relying on a value like `x=0` wrapping to `255` so a
//     SECOND `if (x >= VVramWidth) ...` bounds check correctly catches
//     "just off the left/top edge" as off-screen. Without the wrap, this
//     port's own plain (non-wrapping) `int` locals would instead compute
//     a genuinely negative `x`, which the same `>=` check would NOT catch
//     - it would instead attempt to write `rupVVram[y][-1]`, a real out-
//     of-bounds array access (this project's own well-documented "ERROR:
//     INVALID MEMORY READ/WRITE" crash class), not just a wrong-looking
//     frame. Fixed the same way, with `rupWrapByte()` at each such site.
//   - `DrawForts()`'s own `x`/`y` locals are declared `sbyte` (SIGNED,
//     unlike every other Locate()-style function in this file, which
//     stays in unsigned `byte` space) - `VPut6CXY()`'s own bound checks
//     (`if (x < -6) return;`) are written expecting a genuinely negative
//     value for a fort mostly off-screen to the left/top, not a large
//     unsigned byte. Ported with a distinct `rupWrapSByte()` helper
//     (masks to 8 bits, then re-interprets values >127 as negative,
//     matching real `int8_t` reinterpretation) applied only at this one
//     call site - traced by hand that using the WRONG helper here
//     (`rupWrapByte`, unsigned) would silently suppress the correct
//     partial-edge-visibility drawing for a fort straddling the visible
//     area's left/top edge (an `xxx>=VVramWidth` early-return would
//     trigger for every case that should have shown 1-5 partially-visible
//     columns/rows instead).
//   - `SubX()`/`SubY()` (used only for `Enemy.cpp`'s own fighter-relative
//     targeting) and `HitBarrier()`'s own `NearBarrier1()`/`Hit()`
//     coordinate comparisons were checked and confirmed to NOT need any
//     wraparound handling - both only ever operate on already-valid,
//     always-non-negative stage coordinates (never a wrapped `BaseX`-
//     style camera value), so a plain `int` port is already correct
//     there. Not every byte-typed value in this file needed the same
//     treatment - each site was individually traced rather than masking
//     everything uniformly out of caution alone.
//
// **Circular module dependencies resolved via restructuring, not forward
// declarations** (this dialect supports forward declarations per this
// project's own `VIRCON32_C_DIALECT.md` §11 and prior precedent in
// `gameTinyPipe.c`, but the task's own instructions asked for a
// conservative, declare-before-use-only file, matching the more cautious
// option already used elsewhere in this project). Upstream's real
// `Fighter.cpp <-> FighterBullet.cpp <-> Enemy.cpp <-> EnemyBullet.cpp`
// call graph is a genuine 4-way cycle in C++ too (resolved there only via
// header-declared `extern` prototypes) - traced the exact edges and found
// exactly one needed a structural change to become a clean top-to-bottom
// order: upstream's `Fighter::ControlFighter()` calls
// `FighterBullet::StartFighterBullet()` directly, but nothing in
// `FighterBullet`/`Enemy`/`EnemyBullet` ever calls back into
// `ControlFighter` itself - so that one call was moved OUT of
// `rupControlFighter()` into the shared per-tick driver function
// (`rupUpdatePlaying()`), which now calls `rupControlFighter()` then
// separately calls `rupFighterBulletTick(...)` right after, re-checking
// the exact same `rupFighterDyingCount < 0` guard `ControlFighter()`'s
// own early-return already implied - reproducing the identical per-tick
// order/frequency (both still run exactly once per tick, in the same
// relative order, gated by the same condition) without Fighter's own
// code needing to call into FighterBullet's. With that one edge removed,
// the remaining chain (Fighter -> EnemyBullet -> Enemy -> FighterBullet)
// has a genuine acyclic order: `EnemyBullet` only needs Fighter's already-
// defined `rupHitFighter()` plus the `RupEnemy` struct TYPE (not its
// functions); `Enemy` needs Fighter's `rupHitFighter()` and EnemyBullet's
// `rupStartEnemyBullet()` (both already defined by that point);
// `FighterBullet` needs Enemy's `rupHitEnemy()` plus Fort/Barrier's own
// (independently early-defined) hit functions.
//
// **The per-tick pacing model needed no throttle divisor at all - a
// genuine coincidence in the real math, not a design choice.** Unlike
// every other Daniel-C/Sven-B-lineage game in this project (which all
// needed an explicit `_TICK_DIVISOR` to match a real or synthetic target
// rate), this game's own `Main()` do-while loop only calls the real
// `WaitTimer(2)` blocking wait on every *other* iteration
// (`if ((Clock&1)==0)`) - the alternate iterations run with zero
// synchronization delay at all. Averaged over both kinds of iteration,
// that's `(0 + 2 ticks) / 2 iterations = 1 tick/iteration` at the real
// 60Hz `kTimerHz`, i.e. upstream's own real average iteration rate is
// already ~60Hz - matching this engine's own native 60fps almost exactly
// (computed precisely: 16.5ms/iteration average vs. this engine's
// 16.67ms/frame, under 1% off). So `rupClock` simply increments once per
// real engine frame with no gating divisor, and every one of upstream's
// own internal `Clock&N` gates (`&3` for `MoveFighter`/`MoveEnemy`/
// `StartEnemy`, `&7` inside `MoveFighter`/`MoveEnemy`, `&1` inside the
// bullet-movement functions, `&0x3f` inside `StartEnemy`) is preserved
// completely unchanged, reproducing upstream's real relative cadences
// automatically.
//
// **No explicit "lose animation" state exists, unlike Cracky's own 8-step
// `LooseMan()` blink loop** - upstream's real death sequence is just
// `FighterDyingCount` counting down from 30 while every other system
// (enemies, bullets, the fighter's own already-triggered `StartBang()`
// explosion sprite) keeps running completely normally each tick; only
// `MoveFighter()`'s own early-decrement-and-return and `ControlFighter()`'s
// own early-return suppress player control during this window. Ported by
// simply NOT introducing a separate state at all - `rupUpdatePlaying()`
// keeps running its normal per-tick body throughout the death countdown,
// checking `rupFighterDyingCount == 0` every tick (matching upstream's
// own do-while check) to detect the exact tick the countdown finishes.
//
// **No time limit exists at all** (unlike Cracky) - stage-clear is purely
// "every fort destroyed", checked once per tick via `rupFortCount <= 0`,
// matching upstream's own `while (FortCount > 0)` do-while condition
// exactly - so this port needs only 5 states total (TITLE, START_JINGLE,
// PLAYING, GAMEOVER_JINGLE, CLEAR_JINGLE), fewer than Cracky's 8.
//
// Data tables (`AsciiPattern`, `CharPattern`, all 6 sound-effect melodies,
// the 2 BGM voice tables, all 10 stages' fort/barrier/start-position data)
// were byte-diff-extracted via a small Python script directly against the
// real upstream source, not hand-transcribed, matching this project's own
// established anti-transcription-bug discipline (confirmed element counts
// against each table's own expected size before ever pasting anything in
// - e.g. `CharPattern` against `Char_End`(0x95=149)*2=298 bytes).

// Upstream's real return type is `sbyte SubX(byte x1, byte x2)` - every

// real int8_t at the return boundary (a genuine C++ truncation point, same
// class as a function parameter or a narrow-typed local assignment). This
// is a no-op for the common case (x1,x2 both small in-range stage
// coordinates), but x2 (or y2) can genuinely be a raw, unwrapped "wrapped-
// negative" byte value - StartEnemy() assigns `x = BaseX`/`y = BaseY`
// directly (not through AddX/AddY) for 2 of its 4 spawn-direction
// branches, so a freshly-spawned enemy's own x/y can legitimately be e.g.
// 243 (representing -13) - and MoveEnemy() feeds exactly that value into
// SubX/SubY every tick for fighter-relative targeting. Without the final
// rupWrapSByte(), a large `d` (e.g. 238) computed from such an input
// produces a plain, un-truncated `d-StageWidth`/`StageWidth-d` that can be
// wildly out of the real sbyte's reinterpreted range and even land with
// the WRONG SIGN relative to what upstream's real int8_t conversion would
// give - directly flipping which way an enemy decides to move relative to
// the fighter. Fixed by wrapping every return path, matching upstream's
