// =============================================================================
// GUNTUS mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, "Cate engine", CH32V003
// RISC-V microcontroller - license "None specified", no LICENSE file in the
// upstream repo) - a Galaga/Xevious-style vertical shooter: steer a fighter
// ship in 4 directions, shoot waves of enemies that fly in along fixed
// courses, form up into rows near the bottom, then peel off individually to
// dive-attack and fire back; clear every enemy to advance to the next of 8
// hand-authored stages, 3 lives, score-only (no hi-score concept upstream at
// all - confirmed by grep, unlike sibling port GUNTUS's own CRACKY).
//
// Ported using gameCracky.c (a sibling Cate-engine game already shipped in
// this cartridge) as the direct structural reference - same author/engine
// lineage (identical AsciiPattern/Frequencies tables, identical VVram/
// CharPattern nibble-interleaved rendering scheme, identical Math.cpp
// Rnd()/Abs()/Sign() helpers). **No hardware-orientation transform of any
// kind is needed** - `gunComposeRawByte()` composes a byte and
// `md_drawColumn(col,page,value)` draws it at its own natural position, no
// mirroring/reversal - matching Cracky's own hard-won conclusion (see that
// file's header) that GUNTUS's own `InitOled()` RightToLeft/BottomToTop
// commands exist purely to correct a real panel-mounting quirk on certain
// physical hardware, with nothing to correct for in software here.
//
// **A second hidden-row staging area, a genuinely different VVram shape
// than Cracky's own**: `VVramHeight = 16 + 2 = 18` (not just 16) - real
// gameplay rendering (`DrawAll()` -> `VVramToVram(VVram + VVramWidth*2)`)
// only ever converts rows 2..17 to real hardware pixels, permanently
// skipping rows 0-1. Traced through `Direction.cpp`'s own `Courses[]` table
// to confirm this is deliberate, not incidental: two of the 8 flight
// courses spawn at row 0 (`{ 12, 0, Direction_Down, ... }`) or exactly the
// bottom visible row 17 (`{ 13, VVramHeight-1, Direction_Up, ... }`) -
// enemies genuinely spawn *above* the visible screen (row 0, invisible)
// and fly down into view, the same "off-screen staging area" idea other
// shooters give a signed/negative Y coordinate, just implemented here as 2
// permanently-hidden VVram rows instead. Reproduced directly:
// `gunComposeRawByte()`'s map-area branch reads `gunVVram[rawPage*2+2]`/
// `[+3]` (a literal `+2` baked into the row lookup) rather than needing any
// runtime row-offset parameter - sprites/stars/enemy-rows all write into
// the full 0-17 row range exactly as upstream does, with rows 0-1 simply
// never making it to `md_drawColumn()`.
//
// **The title screen's own real bitmap logo (`TitleBytes[]`) is drawn via
// a completely different, UNSHIFTED `VVramToVram(VVram)` call than every
// gameplay frame uses (no `+VVramWidth*2`) - a genuinely different row
// addressing for this one screen only, not just cosmetic text.** An
// earlier version of this port "simplified" this real, prominent pixel-
// art wordmark down to small plain text instead (matching an equally
// wrong earlier decision in sibling game Cracky) - **corrected, later in
// the same session, once Cracky's own identical mistake was found and
// fixed first**: `gunTitleBytes[]` (byte-diff-verified against the real
// upstream table) is now drawn directly into `gunVVram` at its own real
// position (row 2, matching upstream's `VVram + VVramWidth*2 + TitleLeft`
// offset), and `gunComposeRawByte()` reads it back out with the correct
// UNSHIFTED row addressing (`rawPage*2`/`+1`, not the gameplay-only
// `rawPage*2+2`/`+3`) whenever `gunFullWidthText` is set - landing the
// logo on real hardware pages 1-2, OR-combined with the "MINI"/
// "INUFUTO 2026"/"START"/"CONTINUE" text drawn into the same real Vram
// text mechanism the status labels use (see `gunComposeRawByte()`'s and
// `gunBeginTitle()`'s own comments for the full derivation, and the later
// "CORRECTED" note further down in this header for the separate, already-
// fixed story of how this area's own real *width* was first modeled
// wrong, then fixed).
//
// **Status text**: GUNTUS's own `PrintStatus()`/`PrintScore()`/
// `PrintRemain()` write real bytes directly to hardware Vram addresses
// (bypassing VVram) at real columns 24-31 (of a genuine 32-char-cell-wide
// row, not just an 8-wide slice - see the "CORRECTED" note below) - the
// exact same address range Cracky's own `crkStatusChar` overlay already
// covers, so the identical grid design (`gunStatusChar`, `gunPrintC`/
// `gunPrintS` writing into it, `gunComposeRawByte()`'s status-area branch
// reading back out of it) was reused directly. `PrintRemain()`'s own
// `Put2C`-drawn 2x2 "extra life"
// ship icon is simplified to a plain digit, matching Cracky's own PrintRemain
// simplification exactly - and, faithfully preserving a genuine upstream
// quirk rather than "fixing" it, nothing is drawn at all (the previous
// frame's own digit just lingers) once `RemainCount` drops to 1 or below,
// since upstream's own `PrintRemain()` only ever writes when
// `RemainCount > 1`. `PrintGameOver()` (page4, char-cell col8, i.e. inside
// the MAP area, not the status area) needed the same kind of overlay-over-
// map trick Cracky's own `crkOverlayActive` mechanism already provides -
// reused directly (`gunOverlayActive`/`gunOverlayText`/`gunOverlayPage`/
// `gunOverlayCol`).
//
// **Sound**: the same real 3-tone-channel software-mixer tracker as
// Cracky's own `Sound.cpp` (`ToneChannel`/`EffectChannel`, a genuine PWM
// synth driven off the SysTick ISR) - not ported at the synthesis level,
// routed straight to `md_playTone(freqHz, durationSeconds)` instead,
// exactly like Cracky. Tempo differs (180 here vs Cracky's own 160), so
// the real per-note-length-unit duration was re-derived from
// `SoundHandler()`'s own formula (`time -= Tempo; if(time<=0) time +=
// 600/2;`): a decrement-event happens once every `300/Tempo` real 60Hz
// ticks, giving `gunNoteFrames(length) = round(length * 300.0/180.0)`
// (≈1.667 ticks/unit here, vs Cracky's own 1.875). `Sound_SmallBang()`/
// `Sound_LargeBang()` are genuine NOISE-channel effects (a real LFSR-
// driven `EffectChannel`, not a melody) with no queued-note equivalent to
// port - approximated as a single representative `md_playTone()` call at
// the effect's own real starting frequency (3000Hz/1500Hz) with a short
// fixed duration, the same "derive the real Hz, approximate the envelope"
// treatment Astro Barrier's own hardware-synth port already established
// in this project. Every melody's own note-pair data (`Sound_Fire`/
// `Sound_Up`/`Sound_Start`/`Sound_GameOver`/`StartBGM`'s two simultaneous
// tracks) was extracted via a small Python script (resolving the real
// `NoteLength`/`Scale` enum values), not hand-transcribed - byte-diff-
// verified counts (13/13/23/18/105/227 values respectively) rather than
// trusted on a first eyeballed copy, per this project's own long-standing
// anti-transcription-bug discipline.
//
// **Data**: `Stages[]`/`Formations0-7[]` (75 formations across 8 stages,
// each a `{elementCount,courseIndex,targets[8],types[2]}` C++ struct
// array) were flattened via the same script into parallel flat arrays
// (`gunFormationElementCount`/`gunFormationCourseIndex`/
// `gunFormationTargets`/`gunFormationTypes`, plus a per-stage
// `gunStageFormationStart`/`gunStageFormationCount` window into the one
// combined 75-entry table) - avoids porting a struct-with-a-pointer-to-
// another-struct-array (`Stage::pFormation`), matching this project's own
// established "flatten to plain parallel arrays" precedent. `Courses[]`'s
// own `elements[10]` fields are shorter than 10 in several C++ literals
// (e.g. `{ 12, 3, 8, 9, 12, 10, 15, InvalidElement }`, only 8 explicit
// values) - C++ aggregate-initialization zero-pads the remaining slots,
// *not* with another `InvalidElement`(255) sentinel - reproduced exactly
// (zero-padded, not 255-padded) via the same extraction script, since a
// literal `0` there is itself a *valid* course-element table index (not a
// second "end" marker) - though tracing the real control flow
// (`MoveTeams()`'s own `courceElementIndex` advance, gated by each
// team's members finishing their course and draining to 0) shows this
// padding is essentially unreachable in practice, a defensive index
// clamp was still added before the array read (see `gunMoveTeams()`)
// rather than trusting that reasoning to hold under every possible
// timing.
//
// **AVR-implicit-byte-wraparound reliance, the same bug family already
// documented extensively elsewhere in this project (byte truncation,
// signed-sentinel, logical-vs-arithmetic-shift, etc) - found via careful
// line-by-line reading before ever compiling, not via a crash report**:
// several `byte`-typed position fields (`MovingEnemy::x/y` in `Move()`,
// `EnemyRowLeft` in `MoveEnemyRows()`, `EnemyBullet::x/y` in
// `MoveEnemyBullets()`, `FighterBullet::y` in `MoveFighterBullets()`,
// `Bang`'s own `Show()` helper) rely on a byte genuinely wrapping past 0
// (to 255) or past 255 (to 0) so that a *much smaller* real-hardware range
// check (e.g. `>= RangeX+1` where RangeX is ~22) catches the wrapped value
// as "out of range" and redirects/ends the object - exactly the intended
// "hit the edge of the playfield" detection. Vircon32's plain, non-
// truncating `int`s would instead let these go genuinely negative,
// silently failing every one of those range checks. **Fixed** the same
// way as this project's very first documented bug: an explicit `& 0xFF`
// mask applied right after each such arithmetic step, at every site listed
// above - confirmed via inspection that this reproduces the exact real
// upstream byte value in every case (all of these mask a *plain sum* of
// already-computed operands, so wrapping once at the end vs. per-step,
// as AVR's own byte arithmetic would, gives identical results by modular-
// arithmetic associativity).
//
// **`switch` and the ternary operator avoided proactively throughout**
// (this dialect's own well-documented lack of support for both,
// established by every prior port in this project) - `DecideDirection()`'s
// one `switch(type)` and `MoveMovingEnemies()`'s one `switch(status)`
// both rewritten as `if`/`else` chains; every `a?b:c` in `Print.cpp`/
// `Bang.cpp` rewritten as plain `if`/`else`.
//
// **Two same-function `goto`s used as genuine structured control flow
// (not blocking-loop conversions) in upstream, both rewritten goto-free**:
// `Team.cpp`'s `MoveTeams()` uses `goto nextCourseElement;` to jump into
// the middle of an `if` block from its own `else` branch - rewritten with
// a small `doLookup` boolean flag gating the shared lookup-and-apply logic
// that both paths need, rather than reproducing the jump. `MovingEnemy.cpp`'s
// `MoveMovingEnemies()` uses two: `goto turn;` (from the Align case into
// the Turn case's own label, when a distance check passes) and
// `goto align;` (from the Return case, re-using the Align case's own
// logic every other tick) - both cases' *shared bodies* were pulled out
// into their own functions (`gunTurnLogicMovingEnemy()`/
// `gunAlignMovingEnemy()`), called directly from every dispatch site that
// upstream's own goto target reaches, rather than trying to replicate
// C++'s cross-case label-jump semantics.
//
// **A deliberate, documented deviation from a literal port**: upstream's
// own `DecideDirection()` for `Type_Insistent` declares `sbyte dx, dy;`
// with NO initial value, only assigning them inside an
// `if ((localClock & LongMask) != 0)` block - meaning on the 1-in-4 calls
// where that condition is false, `dx`/`dy` are read as genuinely
// uninitialized stack memory on real AVR hardware (a real, if minor,
// latent bug in the original game, not a deliberate quirk with any
// well-defined "intended" result to preserve). Rather than reproduce
// undefined behavior (impossible to define meaningfully on this platform
// anyway) or silently default to `(0,0)` (a fresh, arbitrary choice with
// no real basis), the port instead reuses the enemy's *own currently-
// stored* `dx`/`dy` (already-persistent struct fields) on that branch -
// the most plausible real interpretation of the evident intent ("mostly
// keep going the same way, only re-target periodically"), documented here
// as a deliberate choice rather than left as an unexamined guess.
//
// =============================================================================
// A later verification pass (this port had only ever been test-compiled,
// never played) - full re-audit against real upstream source, plus live
// Puppeteer testing on an isolated build/server. Found and fixed 3 real
// bugs, the first of which was almost certainly the actual cause of any
// "game state progression" issue reported for this title:
//
// **1) CRITICAL - a genuinely unterminated sound-melody array left the
// game permanently stuck on the GAME OVER screen.** Counting the real
// token list in `Sound.cpp`'s `Sound_GameOver()` directly (not eyeballed)
// showed its `notes[]` array holds exactly 18 bytes (9 real length/note
// pairs) with **no trailing terminator byte** - unlike `Sound_Fire()`/
// `Sound_Up()`/`Sound_Start()`, which all end with an explicit extra `0`.
// This is a genuine bug in the *original* game, not a porting slip: on
// real AVR flash it's harmless-by-luck (`ToneChannel::Next()` just reads
// whatever byte happens to sit right after the array in ROM as if it
// were the next note), but this port's `gunMelodyGameOver` was declared
// `int[18]` with the same 18 real values and nothing after it - reading
// index 18 (`gunMelodyValue(GUN_MELODY_GAMEOVER, 18)`) lands directly in
// the very next declared global, `gunMelodyBgm1[0]` (=18, non-zero), so
// the sequencer's own "did we hit a real 0-length end marker" check never
// fires and `gunSeqPlaying(1)` never goes false - `gunUpdateGameOverJingle()`
// then never calls `gunBeginTitle()`, permanently freezing on GAME OVER
// (misinterpreting BGM1's own note data as an endless stream of more
// GameOver notes). **Confirmed live**: an early Puppeteer soak test
// reliably reached GAME OVER through real play, then sat on that exact
// screen for 10+ real seconds with zero further state change - many times
// longer than the melody's own real ~2.9s duration. **Fixed** by adding
// the missing terminator (`gunMelodyGameOver` extended from 18 to 19
// elements, trailing `0` appended) - reproduces what was clearly the
// intended upstream behavior rather than the real out-of-bounds read.
// Re-verified two ways after rebuilding: (a) a temporary deterministic
// debug hook (forcing `gunRemainCount=0` a few ticks into a fresh game,
// fully removed again afterward - confirmed via a project-wide grep for
// its own marker name) showed a clean GAME OVER -> title cycle completing
// within the expected ~7s window; (b) a second, undoctored soak test
// reaching GAME OVER through genuine random collisions also cleanly
// returned to the title screen. `gunMelodyLength()`'s own (dead-code,
// never actually called - confirmed by grep) GAMEOVER case was also
// updated to report 19 for consistency, though it has no effect on
// behavior either way.
//
// **2) A real out-of-bounds array read/write in the enemy-row attack
// dispatcher, found by careful reading, not a crash report.**
// `gunMoveEnemyRows()`'s attack-row picker decrements `gunNextRow` every
// time it needs to search for a live row to promote to an attacker,
// relying - like upstream's own real `byte nextRow` - on the value
// *wrapping* past 0 to a large number (255 on real AVR) so the following
// `if (nextRow >= EnemyRowCount) nextRow = EnemyRowCount - 1;` catches it
// and resets it. Vircon32's plain, non-wrapping `int` instead lets
// `gunNextRow` go genuinely negative (-1, -2, ...) - which a `>=` check
// against a small positive `EnemyRowCount` can never catch - so once
// every row has been cycled through once, `gunNextRow` keeps counting
// down forever, and `gunStartAttacking(rowIndex)` gets called with a
// **negative index**, reading/writing `gunEnemyRowMemberCount[-1]`,
// `gunEnemyRowType[-1]`, `gunEnemyRowFlags[-1][...]`, etc - a genuine
// out-of-bounds memory access that would eventually corrupt an unrelated
// global or hard-crash with "ERROR: INVALID MEMORY READ/WRITE" the longer
// a level's own attack-row rotation kept running (this is the same "the
// row-formation loop reruns every ~16 ticks for as long as enemies
// remain in the stage" cadence that made the earlier GAME OVER bug so
// easy to hit too - a normal playthrough exercises this path constantly).
// **Fixed** the same way as every other AVR-implicit-byte-wraparound bug
// already documented in this file: an explicit `& 0xFF` mask applied
// right after the decrement (`gunNextRow = ( gunNextRow - 1 ) & 0xFF;`),
// reproducing the real byte wraparound so the existing bounds-reset check
// works as intended. Verified via the same live Puppeteer session: an
// extended ~150-round soak test (repeated movement + firing, cycling
// through multiple full enemy-row rotations) rendered cleanly throughout
// with no crash or corruption, and correctly reached and cleared stage 1
// (STAGE display advancing 1 -> 2) partway through.
//
// **3) A minor, real audio-continuity gap**: `gunStopBgm()` only stopped
// the sequencer state for channels 1/2 (the BGM tracks), not channel 0
// (the Fire/Up SFX channel) - upstream's own `StopBGM()` resets ALL 3
// `ToneChannels`. Since `gunAdvanceSound()` unconditionally advances every
// channel's sequencer every tick regardless of game state, a fire/up cue
// still mid-flight the instant the game ended could re-trigger
// `md_playTone()` a few frames later, bleeding into the GAME OVER jingle.
// **Fixed** by adding `gunStopSeq(0)` alongside the existing
// `gunStopSeq(1)`/`gunStopSeq(2)` calls.
//
// **Extensively checked and confirmed already correct** (not just
// skipped): every data table was re-extracted from the real upstream
// source via a Python script and byte-diffed against the port's own
// arrays, not eyeballed - `gunCharPattern` (286 values) and
// `gunAsciiPattern` (108 values) both matched exactly; the full 75-entry
// `Stages.cpp` formation table (`elementCount`/`courseIndex`/`targets[8]`/
// `types[2]` for every one of the 8 stages' own `Formations0-7[]`)
// matched exactly via an automated diff, including the documented zero-
// vs-255 padding distinction; `Direction.cpp`'s `Directions[]`/
// `CourseElements[]`/`Courses[]` tables (spawn x/y/direction/sallyCount/
// elements for all 8 courses) all matched exactly, including course 6/7's
// own row-0/row-17 "hidden staging area" spawn points. `VVramToVram()`'s
// real byte-composition formula (the `sub==0/1/2/3` 4-way nibble split in
// `gunComposeRawByte()`) was independently re-derived from `Vram.cpp`'s
// own `SendUL()`/`Put2C()` calls and confirmed to match exactly, as did
// the `row0 = rawPage*2+2` "+2 hidden row" offset (re-derived directly
// from `VVramToVram(VVram + VVramWidth*2)`'s own pointer arithmetic, not
// just trusted from the original port's own claim). `Bang.cpp`'s own
// genuine double-offset quirk (`Show()`'s internal `-Size` stacking with
// an already-offset call-site position for the 4 "large" bang corners,
// but not for the single "small" bang case) was traced pixel-by-pixel and
// confirmed the port's `gunBangShowOne()` reproduces the exact same final
// positions in every case. `MoveTeams()`'s goto-based `nextCourseElement`
// control flow, `MoveMovingEnemies()`'s cross-case Align/Turn/Return goto
// chain, `EnemyBullet`'s Bresenham-style fixed-point velocity accumulator
// (confirmed to stay safely within its own bounded envelope regardless of
// numerator, no wraparound risk), `Fighter.cpp`'s crash/revive/blink
// state machine, `FighterBullet`/`Item`'s start/move/hit logic, and the
// title-screen selection/fire-edge-detection were all traced line-by-line
// against upstream and confirmed to match, including several places where
// upstream's own degenerate `CoordShift=0` constants (`CoordMask`,
// `FighterBullet`'s `HalfMask`) collapse conditions to unconditionally-
// true/false and the port correctly preserves that same degeneracy rather
// than "helpfully" adding logic upstream doesn't actually have. The
// `DecideDirection()`/`Type_Insistent` deliberate-deviation reasoning
// (reusing the enemy's own persisted dx/dy instead of upstream's
// genuinely-uninitialized stack read) was re-examined and reconfirmed
// reasonable - it doesn't materially change formation/attack behavior.
// The whole-tick pacing (`GUN_TICK_DIVISOR=3`) was independently
// re-derived from `Timer.cpp`'s own real `kTimerHz=60` SysTick and
// `WaitTimer(3)` call in `Main()`'s loop and confirmed to be an exact
// match (20fps), not an approximation.
//
// **CORRECTED, later in the session: the "CONTINU" truncation above was
// never a real hard limit - it was a self-inflicted design bug, the same
// one found and fixed across nearly every sibling Cate-engine port in
// this batch.** A real user-supplied photo of Cracky (this game's own
// sibling and structural reference) running on actual UIAPduino hardware
// showed "CONTINUE" spelled out in full, "MINI" genuinely present, and
// the whole title layout using real estate far wider than 8 columns.
// Re-reading upstream's real `Status.cpp` directly (both this game's own
// and Cracky's, which are structurally identical - see the two excerpts
// below) confirmed why: `PrintC()`/`PrintS()` write to a real 16-bit Vram
// address spanning the FULL physical screen width - `VramStep=4` real
// pixels/char-cell, 128 real pixels / 4 = a genuine 32-char-cell-wide
// row, not 8. The status labels (SCORE/STAGE/lives) really are confined
// to a narrow slice - `LeftX=24` places them at columns 24-31, the
// rightmost 8 cells - but the *title screen's* own text (MINI at column
// 17, START/CONTINUE at column 9, the "INUFUTO 2026" credit at column
// 12) lives at columns 0-23, well inside what during real gameplay is
// the map/VVram area, using the exact same shared `PrintC()`/`PrintS()`
// call at different column arguments - there is no separate "status-only
// text zone" concept upstream at all, just one shared wide canvas with
// the status labels living in one corner of it.
//
// This port's own `gunStatusChar` was modeled as an 8-column-wide grid
// (`[8][8]`) - correct for the status labels alone (LeftX=24..31 really
// is only 8 cells) - but then the *title screen's* text was also routed
// through that same narrow grid, reusing columns 24-31 that the status
// labels also need. That's the literal, single root cause of "CONTINUE"
// (8 real chars) overflowing an 8-cell grid by one column, "MINI"/"START"
// having nowhere to go without landing on SCORE/STAGE's own columns, and
// the credit line getting shortened/relocated to a wrong page/column
// entirely (see the old, now-corrected `gunBeginTitle()` this replaced -
// it had "INUFUTO" truncated to 7 letters at page 4 col 0, instead of the
// real "INUFUTO 2026" at page 7 col 12).
//
// **Fixed** by widening `gunStatusChar` to `int[8][32]`, updating every
// `gunPrintStatus()`/`gunPrintScore()`/`gunPrintRemain()` column argument
// to upstream's own real `LeftX`-based columns, and adding a
// `gunFullWidthText` flag (true only in `GUN_STATE_TITLE`) that lets
// `gunComposeRawByte()` read the full 32-column range instead of just
// columns 24-31 while the title screen is showing - `gunBeginTitle()` was
// rewritten to place "MINI"/"START"/"CONTINUE" (now the complete 8-letter
// word)/the "INUFUTO 2026" credit line at upstream's own literal columns,
// all genuinely clear of the status labels' own columns 24-31, with
// nothing left over needing to be dropped or truncated. This is the exact
// same fix already applied to gameCracky.c (the reference this port was
// built from in the first place) - see that file's own header comment
// for the full original derivation and the live-hardware-photo evidence
// that prompted it.
//
// **A small, deliberately un-replicated timing nuance, documented rather
// than chased**: upstream's real `Main()` loop reaches a stage-clear via
// `goto stage;`, which - because it jumps directly into the following
// tick's own logic body without an intervening `WaitTimer(3)` pace gate -
// runs one extra, un-paced movement+redraw pass in the same real instant
// as the transition, and skips incrementing `Clock` for that specific
// loop iteration. This port's `gunUpdatePlaying()` (a `return`-based
// state machine, not a `goto`) does still increment `gunClock` on a
// stage-clear tick and does not replicate that extra un-paced pass -
// shifting the movement-gating parity by one tick and delaying the new
// stage's first visible movement by one real paced tick (~50ms) after a
// transition. Confirmed via live testing that stage-clear itself works
// correctly (STAGE display advancing, enemies of the new stage spawning
// and behaving normally) - this is a sub-frame-scale cosmetic pacing
// difference with no effect on scoring/lives/win-loss logic, not chased
// further given the real risk of a larger control-flow restructure for
// an imperceptible gain.

// **Rewritten after the same real user-supplied hardware photo (of sibling
// game Cracky) that overturned Cracky's own equivalent function proved
// this port's earlier version was simply wrong too.** The earlier version
// believed upstream's own title-screen text collided with the SCORE/
// STAGE/lives status labels and had to be trimmed/relocated/dropped to
// fit - "CONTINUE" was truncated to "CONTINU", and the credit line was
// shortened to bare "INUFUTO" and moved to the wrong page/column. Re-
// reading upstream's real `Status.cpp` (`Title()`) line by line shows
// this diagnosis was backwards: none of that text ever collides with
// anything upstream, because upstream's own Vram address space is a
// genuinely wide 32-char-cell-per-page canvas (see gunStatusChar's own
// header comment) - the status labels occupy only columns 24-31
// (upstream's own `LeftX=24`), and every piece of title-screen text sits
// at columns 0-23, well clear of them. The ROOT problem was this port's
// own `gunStatusChar` being modeled as an 8-column-wide grid in the first
// place - now fixed there, this function is rewritten to place everything
// at upstream's real, literal columns, with `gunFullWidthText=true` so
// gunComposeRawByte() renders the full canvas instead of just the narrow
// status zone.
//
// **A second architectural bug, found and fixed later in the same
// session, once gameCracky.c's own equivalent function was corrected
// first**: upstream's real bitmap title logo (`TitleBytes[]`, drawn
// directly into VVram via a literal 80-value table) had been "simplified"
// to plain small text here, reasoning it was "purely decorative, non-
// gameplay-relevant" - the same incorrect judgment call gameCracky.c's
// own title screen made and then reverted (see that file's own header
// for the full story). It's not decorative filler - it's the single
// largest, most prominent element on the whole title screen, and the
// small ASCII font used as a substitute is missing several letters (no
// L/H/Y/W/D/K) that a real game title could easily need. **Fixed** by
// drawing `gunTitleBytes[]` directly into `gunVVram` at its own real
// position (VVram rows 2-5, upstream's own `VVram + VVramWidth*2 +
// TitleLeft` starting offset, TitleLeft=2) instead of printing text -
// `gunComposeRawByte()` was updated to OR-combine this VVram content with
// `gunStatusChar`'s own text layer (see that function's own header for
// why this is safe) rather than choosing one exclusively.
