// Tiny Blocks (RobotMasterC, license "None specified" - confirmed via the
// GitHub API, `"license": null`, no LICENSE file anywhere in the repo).
// Credited "ROBOTMASTERC" in the menu (the repo owner's own GitHub
// handle, no real name stated anywhere in the repo or its README) - the
// same "known-but-unstated-license, credit the real handle" treatment
// already used for Datacute/Sunpazed/Hoangminh5210119.
//
// **The menu title, this file's own name, and every mention in this
// project's own documentation deliberately avoid the trademarked genre
// name the upstream repo itself is titled after** ("TinyTetris") - that
// name is a registered trademark, the same reasoning and treatment
// already applied to Falling Blocks and Blocks Gold. Unlike those two,
// this game's own code never actually draws that word on screen at all
// (confirmed by reading the full source - no font/text-drawing calls
// exist anywhere in it), so there was no on-screen string to rename,
// only the repo/file/menu naming itself.
//
// Found via a driver-header-based discovery approach, at direct user
// request: rather than searching by genre name, enumerate the actual
// `#include` driver-header filenames already used across every game
// staged in `more games/` (`FastTinyDriver.h`, `ssd1306xled.h`,
// `Tiny4kOLED.h`, etc) and search for those specific filenames instead -
// this repo turned up via a `"FastTinyDriver.h" github` search that
// surfaced an unrelated Hack Club "Summer of Making" student devlog
// mentioning it, which led to the real repo
// (`github.com/RobotMasterC/TinyTetris`) once traced through. Confirmed
// by reading the full 457-line source directly (not assumed from the
// devlog's own summary) to be a genuine, complete, independently-
// written Tetris clone - its own from-scratch piece table, board
// representation, rotation/wall-kick logic, and level/line-clear system
// share no code with any of this project's other three already-shipped
// Tetris-genre games (Falling Blocks, Blocks Gold - both Andy-Jackson-
// lineage; ATtiny Tetromino - sunpazed/jfoucher lineage) - the same
// "verify via real diff/reading before dismissing on genre alone"
// discipline this project has applied to every prior candidate. A 4th
// entry in an already-well-covered genre, ported specifically because
// the user confirmed it was worth it after reviewing this exact
// distinction (own codebase, plus a genuinely unique hybrid input
// scheme - see below).
//
// Real hardware: ATtiny85 + a 128x32 I2C OLED (not 128x64 - confirmed
// via the repo's own README BOM) + 3 physical buttons, built on
// `Tiny4kOLED.h` (the same datacute library already used by TinyBullsAndCows
// and ATtiny Tetromino) - needed no new shim.
//
// **The board is genuinely rendered rotated 90 degrees from a normal
// top-down view - the exact same structural shape already solved for
// ATtiny Tetromino** (itself also a 128x32/Tiny4kOLED-family game).
// Traced the real byte layout directly from `drawBoard()`/`drawNext()`
// rather than assumed: the board's own Y axis (gravity, `current.y`,
// 32 rows tall) maps to real screen COLUMNS (each logical row occupies
// 3 consecutive physical columns, starting at physical column 31), while
// the board's own X axis (native left/right, `current.x`) maps to real
// screen PAGE+BIT position (the vertical axis, via `screenX = col*3-2`
// then split into `page=screenX/8`/`bit=screenX%8`). On an unrotated
// Vircon32 screen, this means a piece genuinely falls LEFT-TO-RIGHT
// across the screen, and upstream's own `LEFT_BTN`/`RIGHT_BTN` (which
// respectively decrement/increment `current.x`) visually move a piece
// UP/DOWN, not left/right (increasing `current.x` increases `screenX`,
// which increases the page/bit position - and increasing page/bit
// position is visually further DOWN the screen in standard SSD1306
// addressing).
//
// **Controls were deliberately remapped to match what the player
// actually sees, exactly mirroring ATtiny Tetromino's own already-
// proven solution to the identical rotation** rather than re-deriving a
// new scheme from scratch: Up/Down trigger upstream's own `LEFT_BTN`/
// `RIGHT_BTN` logic respectively (`isUpPressed()` -> `canMoveLeft()`/
// `current.x--`, since that's what visually moves the piece up on this
// unrotated screen; `isDownPressed()` -> the mirror), Fire rotates
// (`ROTATE_BTN`), and Left/Right both trigger the fast-drop gesture
// described below (matching ATtiny Tetromino's own "Left/Right both
// soft-drop" choice for the same reason - there's no single obviously-
// correct button for accelerating a sideways-visual fall, so both
// directions do it).
//
// Upstream's own `analogRead(0) < 950` check (fed directly into
// `fallDelay`, bypassing the level-based table entirely whenever true)
// is genuinely unusual - the BOM states only 3 physical buttons, and no
// 4th button pin is ever configured anywhere in the file, yet this
// reads a raw analog value on a pin with no declared button behind it.
// Read literally as intended: a real, if minimally-documented, "hold to
// drop faster" gesture via *some* physical input wired to that pin in
// the real hardware (unclear from the repo alone whether it's a 4th
// button, a pot, or something else) - ported as a genuine gesture rather
// than dropped as inert, mapped to Left/Right per the paragraph above.
//
// **Upstream's own bit-packed board (`boardPixels`, 1 bit per cell,
// addressed via `pixelPos/8`/`pixelPos%8`) was ported as a plain
// `int[32][16]` grid instead** (`tnbBoard`), matching this project's own
// established precedent for every prior TinyTetris-family bit-packed
// board (Falling Blocks' `bool[10][24]`, ATtiny Tetromino's
// `bool[16][24]`) - no benefit to bit-packing on Vircon32, and it avoids
// re-deriving whether this specific packing scheme carries any of the
// AVR-implicit-shift risks already documented extensively elsewhere in
// this project, by simply not needing any shift arithmetic on the board
// data at all.
//
// A genuine, faithfully-preserved upstream rendering quirk, not
// "corrected": `drawBoard()` only ever draws the LEFT border of the
// playfield as a real visible line (a solid column at physical position
// 30) - the RIGHT border (upstream's own `col >= 11` cells, 5 columns
// wide) is never rendered at all, even though it's real, solid,
// collision-active board data (`boardPixels` is initialized with those
// cells set to 1 in `setup()`, and every collision check reads them
// correctly) - just invisible on screen. Ported exactly as observed:
// the right wall stops pieces correctly, but nothing is drawn there.
//
// Upstream's own 7-piece bag-pick trick (`nextId = random(8); if
// (nextId==7) nextId = random(7);`, and a fuller `... || nextId==
// current.id ...` variant at the mid-game refill site) is ported
// verbatim via the shared `arand()` helper rather than simplified to a
// direct `arand(7)` - preserves upstream's own real (if slightly
// unusual) distribution technique exactly, including the fact that the
// two call sites use genuinely different conditions (the initial setup
// pick has no "don't repeat the current piece" guard, only the mid-game
// refill does).
//
// Real `millis()`-gated timers (the 100ms move-repeat cooldown, the
// 150ms rotate-repeat cooldown, and the full per-level `fallDelay`
// table, 10ms-720ms) were all converted to plain frame-counted
// equivalents (`60fps` throughout, e.g. 100ms -> 6 frames, 150ms -> 9
// frames) rather than an accumulator - exact real-time correspondence
// isn't critical for these arbitrary hobby-project tuning values, and a
// plain frame-count comparison is simpler and lower-risk than porting a
// real-millisecond `unsigned long` timer model. The very fastest fall-
// speed tiers (10ms/20ms) both round down to a 1-frame minimum, which is
// the fastest this engine's own 60fps tick rate can represent regardless
// - functionally still "drops every tick," matching upstream's own
// near-instant intent at those extreme levels.
//
// No score exists in this game at all (only `linesCount`/`gameLevel`,
// confirmed via a full read - no `score` variable anywhere in the
// source) and no EEPROM usage exists upstream either - left fully
// session-only, matching this project's own precedent for other
// beyond-scope ports with nothing meaningful to persist.
//
// A genuine attract screen and a real game-over screen (with a restart
// gesture) were added - upstream has neither: it starts playing
// immediately from `setup()`, and its own real game-over path is a
// literal AVR `sleep_mode()` call with no wake/restart path at all other
// than a hardware reset, which has no meaningful equivalent on this
// engine. Both new screens stay confined to the same physical pages 0-3
// (32 rows) the real gameplay itself occupies, for visual consistency -
// pages 4-7 are implicitly left blank every frame (the shared
// `tnbDisplayClear()` call already zeroes the whole buffer, and nothing
// ever writes into those pages), the same "confine everything to the
// game's own real physical footprint" approach already used for ATtiny
// Tetromino/Tiny Bulls And Cows/Laser Pong.
