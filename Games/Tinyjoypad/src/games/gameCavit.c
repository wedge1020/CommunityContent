// CAVIT mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, license "None specified" -
// GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_cavit`) - a Boulder-Dash-
// flavored cave digger: walk a 12-column x 6-row cave, digging through soil,
// collecting every treasure box to clear the stage, while dropping rocks on
// chasing "Chaser"/"Ghost" monsters to kill them. Ghosts can occasionally
// phase through un-dug walls to follow you (a real, deliberate mechanic, not
// a bug - see cavGhostCanMove()). 10 hand-authored stages, 3 lives, no
// hi-score at all (upstream's own Main.h/Main.cpp declares no such field,
// not even commented out - unlike the sibling `gameOsotos.c` port, which
// found a genuinely commented-out one; this game never had one to begin
// with, so none is added here either).
//
// Built the same way as the sibling `gameCracky.c`/`gameOsotos.c` ports from
// this same upstream author/engine ("Cate engine") - see gameCracky.c's own
// header for the shared methodology (real SSD1306 streamed one raw byte at a
// time via `Locate()`+`SendOledData()`, no framebuffer; a real 60Hz SysTick
// frame limiter, `Timer.cpp`'s `WaitTimer(t)`; only 4 directions + 1 action
// button, `ScanKeys.h`'s `Keys_Button0`, mapped onto `tinyJoypadShim.h`'s
// existing isXPressed() functions with no new shim needed - isFire2Pressed()
// goes unused here, matching every sibling in this family).
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform, on purpose** - the same
// already-settled finding as Cracky/Osotos (see gameCracky.c's own header
// for the real investigation and the user-supplied reference photo that
// settled it): `Oled.cpp` here uses the identical `SegRemap`/`ComScanDec`
// commands for the identical real-panel-mounting reason, with nothing to
// correct for in a from-scratch software recreation. `cavComposeRawByte()`
// draws directly at its own `(col,page)` - no mirror, no flip, no bit
// reversal, no lookup table.
//
// **Rendering takes a real shortcut past upstream's own incremental VVram
// Back/Front dual-buffer + dirty-diff `Backup[]` scheme**, matching this
// project's own standing "always redraw the full frame" rule harder than
// Cracky's own port did: rather than porting the incremental buffer, this
// port keeps `cavTerrainMap[]` (a `MapWidth*MapHeight` byte array, exactly
// mirroring upstream's own `TerrainMap[]`) as the single source of truth,
// mutated at the exact same real gameplay sites upstream mutates it (man
// digging through a cell, a rock passing through/landing, a box/rock
// occupying a cell), and *recomputes the whole VVram grid fresh from it
// every single frame* (`cavRenderVVramFromState()`) - the same "faithfully
// copy an intricate stateful *algorithm*, not the stateful *cache*" choice
// already used for Cracky's own `crkMapToVVram()`. This is possible because
// `DrawTerrain(x,y,terrain)` in the real source is a pure function of the
// terrain byte (a glyph-lookup table keyed by the byte's own wall-bits
// nibble) - it never needs to know what was drawn last frame. Every call
// site that upstream uses purely to *push a display update* in response to
// a terrain mutation (there are many - MoveMan, TestRocks, MoveRocks, ...)
// is therefore simply dropped in this port: only the *state* mutation is
// kept, since the fresh per-frame recompute already reflects it automatically.
//
// **One real, deliberate cosmetic simplification within that same
// shortcut**: `MoveMan()`'s own mid-cell-transition branch calls
// `DrawTerrainBytes(x,y, MidChars+(direction<<1))` - a small 16-entry table
// of "half-dug" corner glyphs shown for exactly one movement-event
// (~8 raw ticks) while the player's sprite visually overlaps a soil cell
// it hasn't fully entered yet. Traced through by hand: this glyph is purely
// decorative (the *terrain state* driving collision/wall-bit logic is
// identical either way - only which glyph gets drawn for that one brief
// transitional frame differs), and reproducing it would need a second,
// short-lived overlay mechanism layered on top of the terrain-recompute
// shortcut above for a cosmetic detail visible for well under a quarter
// second. Dropped - the cell just renders as still-solid-soil for that one
// beat instead of the special "you're digging in" glyph, then flips to the
// correct dug-out look exactly on schedule once the player reaches full-
// cell alignment (the same "effort/fidelity tradeoff for a purely
// decorative, non-gameplay detail" precedent used throughout this whole
// project, e.g. Space Attack's dropped attract-screen slide-in).
//
// **The title screen's own text now uses upstream's real, wide 32-char-cell
// canvas, matching gameCracky.c's own already-fixed reference design** -
// see `cavStatusChar`'s own header comment for the full story of why an
// earlier version of this port (like nearly every sibling in this whole
// Cate-engine batch) modeled the status-text grid as a too-narrow `[8][8]`,
// confining ALL title-screen text into the same 8-column zone the live
// SCORE/STAGE/TIME labels also use. That earlier model was **meticulously
// re-verified this session and found to still have two real, undisclosed
// rendering bugs**, on top of the one (STAGE/MINI) it had already
// documented and accepted:
// 1. **"START" silently overwrote the live "TIME" value's own first
//    digit.** Confirmed via live testing (Puppeteer/WebGL): the title
//    screen showed "START 0" on one row instead of a clean "START" /
//    "TIME  0" split. Root cause: with everything crammed into the old
//    8-column-wide grid, "START" (5 chars starting at local col1) and
//    `cavPrintTime()`'s own value (3 digits starting at local col5)
//    shared the exact same page (5) and column range purely as an
//    artifact of the cramped model - not present upstream, whose own real
//    `LeftX=24`-based status columns (24-31) never share a page/column
//    with `ArrowX=8`-based menu text (cols 8-16) at all.
// 2. **A genuine out-of-bounds array read**, found by direct inspection
//    once the OOB-read audit below turned attention to every array index
//    derived from user-controllable/state-derived values in this file:
//    a fixed (landed) rock's own terrain cell ORs `CAV_TERRAIN_ROCK`(4)
//    onto whatever base terrain type was already there, giving a combined
//    type value of 4-7 - upstream's own `DrawTerrain()` is *never* actually
//    invoked with the rock bit already combined into the type (its own
//    wall-bits-computation loop runs before rocks/boxes are ever applied
//    to the map, and a rock's own icon is drawn via a separate `VPut2CXY`
//    overlay that bypasses the solid-codes lookup entirely) - but this
//    port's own "recompute the whole grid fresh every frame" shortcut
//    (see above) re-evaluates *every* cell's terrain type every frame,
//    including rock-occupied ones, and would read `cavSolidCodes[]` up to
//    16 elements past its real 12-entry bound for such a cell. See
//    `cavRenderVVramFromState()`'s own inline comment for the fix (masking
//    the rock bit out of the type used for glyph selection) - the visible
//    result was never actually wrong (the rock's own icon, drawn moments
//    later in the same function, always overwrote the garbage before it
//    was ever displayed), but the out-of-bounds read itself was real.
//
// **Fixed the same way as gameCracky.c**: `cavStatusChar` widened to
// `[8][32]` (matching upstream's real Vram address space - VramStep=4 real
// pixels/cell, 128/4=32 cells/page), a new `cavFullWidthText` flag (true
// only during `CAV_STATE_TITLE`) lets `cavComposeRawByte()` read the status
// grid across the *entire* screen width instead of just columns 96-127
// while the title screen is showing, and `cavBeginTitle()` places every
// piece of text at upstream's own real, literal columns (`Status.cpp`'s
// `Title()`: the "CAVIT" logo at VVram-derived column 2, "MINI" at column
// 17, "START"/"CONTINUE" at column 9 with the shared cursor at column 8,
// the "INUFUTO 2026" credit at column 12) - none of which collide with the
// status labels' own real columns 24-31 anymore, so nothing needs
// trimming, relocating, or dropping: "CONTINUE" is spelled out in full
// (not truncated to "CONTINU"), and the credit line - dropped entirely by
// an earlier version of this port for lack of room - is restored.
// `cavInitTrying()` (the real gameplay-entry point) clears the full
// 32-column grid and resets `cavFullWidthText` to false as a defensive
// belt-and-suspenders guard, matching `crkInitTrying()`'s own identical
// pattern - without the full-width clear, stale title-screen text from
// columns 8-23 would otherwise bleed into gameplay the same way this exact
// bug class has already been found and fixed in Cracky itself.
//
// **A second, later architectural fix - restoring the real "CAVIT" logo
// bitmap itself, matching the identical fix subsequently applied to
// gameCracky.c's own "CRACKY" wordmark**: the widening above was real and
// correct, but it still only carried a plain-text "CAVIT" substitute
// (`sCavit`, reasoned at the time as "purely decorative, matching Cracky's
// own identical simplification") - the same wrong judgment call
// independently made (and then corrected) in Cracky's own port: upstream's
// real `Title()` draws a genuine 20x4-VVram-cell hand-authored pixel-art
// wordmark (`TitleBytes[]`), not throwaway filler - it's the single
// biggest, most prominent element on the whole title screen. Restored in
// `cavBeginTitle()` by drawing `cavTitleBytes[]` (byte-diff-verified
// against the real upstream table via a small script) directly into
// `cavVVram` at VVram rows 2-5, columns 2-21 (`TitleLeft=(24-4*5)/2=2`,
// matching upstream's own `VVramFront + VVramWidth*2 + TitleLeft` offset
// exactly - real hardware pages 1-2). `cavComposeRawByte()` was updated to
// OR-combine this VVram/map byte with `cavStatusChar`'s own text byte
// instead of choosing one exclusively (previously: during
// `cavFullWidthText`, the map layer was skipped entirely, which is exactly
// why the earlier plain-text substitute was needed in the first place) -
// safe since the logo and every status-text element occupy disjoint
// column ranges even on the one page (1) they'd otherwise share (the logo
// spans columns 2-21, `cavPrintScore()`'s own value starts at column 26).
// Confirmed `cavCharPattern[]`'s own "logo" range (indices 0-15, the first
// 32 bytes of the table) is already byte-identical to upstream's own
// `CharPattern[]` "logo" section via the same script - no data-table fix
// was needed there, only the drawing loop and the compose-byte function.
//
// **A related, deliberately-restored fidelity fix**: `cavBeginTitle()` now
// resets `cavStageTime = 0` before drawing the title screen, matching a
// real, user-confirmed bug fix already applied to Cracky ("on game over,
// the time value remains visible on titlescreen") - upstream's own
// `Title()` never touches `StageTime` at all, so on real hardware the
// post-game-over title screen would show whatever stale countdown value
// was left over from the moment of death; Cracky's own fix (backed by a
// direct user report) established that this reads as a bug rather than a
// faithful quirk worth preserving, so the same explicit reset is applied
// here for consistency across the whole family rather than deferring to
// upstream's own literal (but user-disliked) behavior.
//
// **The blocking upstream control flow rewritten as an explicit frame-
// stepped state machine**, the usual treatment: CAV_STATE_TITLE, CAV_STATE_
// START_JINGLE (the blocking `Sound_Start()` held before play begins, then
// `StartBGM()`), CAV_STATE_PLAYING, CAV_STATE_LOSE_ANIM (`LooseMan()`'s own
// 8-step blink-and-beep loop), CAV_STATE_GAMEOVER_JINGLE, CAV_STATE_
// CLEAR_JINGLE (upstream calls `Sound_Clear()` immediately after `StopBGM()`
// with no separate wait state first, unlike Cracky's own sibling port which
// needed one - confirmed directly against this game's own real `Main.cpp`,
// not assumed identical to Cracky), and CAV_STATE_BONUS_TALLY (the real
// `while(StageTime>=BonusRate){AddScore(3);...Sound_Beep();}` loop,
// converted to one decrement+beep per real tick, matching this project's
// own HollowSeeker/Ardumania bonus-tally precedent).
//
// **A genuinely two-tier real-time model, not flattened to one rate** -
// the single riskiest structural decision in this port, and a real
// departure from every prior Cate-engine port in this project (which all
// only ever needed one flat tick divisor). Upstream's own main loop runs
// `MoveRocks()` on *every* raw iteration, completely unthrottled, while
// `MoveMan()`/`MoveChasers()`/`MoveGhosts()`/the whole timer/scoring logic
// only run when `(Clock&3)==0`, and the real `WaitTimer(1)` pacing calls
// only fire on that same `(Clock&3)==0` iteration (once) plus a *second*
// extra wait specifically on `(Clock&7)==0` - alternating real-tick costs
// of 2,1,2,1,... per "logic interval". Traced through by hand (see the
// exact iteration-by-iteration derivation this session worked out): between
// any two consecutive logic-intervals, `MoveRocks()` always gets called
// exactly 4 times, regardless of which of the two alternating real-tick
// costs that interval itself needed - so rocks fall a real, deliberate 4x
// faster (in raw step-accumulator terms) than the player/monsters move,
// the core Boulder-Dash "falling rocks are fast and dangerous" feel.
// Reproduced with `cavIntervalIndex`/`cavFrameAccum`, an accumulator
// requiring 2 real engine frames on even interval indices and 1 on odd
// ones (averaging 1.5 real frames/interval, ~40Hz at this engine's native
// 60fps - matching the derived real hardware rate), with each interval
// running the full logic body once and `cavMoveRocks()` a flat
// `CAV_ROCK_SUBTICKS`(4) times in a row. A deliberate, documented
// simplification of upstream's own more intricate real interleaving
// (which splits those 4 rock-move calls as 1-before-this-interval's-draw
// plus 3-trailing-into-the-next-interval's-own-logic) - functionally
// indistinguishable for gameplay purposes, since `MoveRocks()` doesn't
// interact with same-tick ordering in any way a player could notice.
//
// **A real byte-wraparound-reliant comparison, ported explicitly rather
// than silently changed** - the same "AVR-implicit-narrow-type-reliance"
// bug family already extensively documented in this project's own
// CLAUDE.md, just via yet another distinct mechanism (an explicit
// `static_cast<byte>` truncation this time, not an implicit one).
// `TestRocks()`'s own "is the player standing directly under this rock"
// check is `static_cast<byte>(man.x - pFixedRock->x + Size/2) < Size` -
// the subtraction can go negative, and upstream deliberately casts it to
// a real 8-bit byte first, relying on the wraparound to produce the
// intended asymmetric 2-unit test window. Reproduced with an explicit
// `& 0xFF` mask (`cavTestRocks()`) rather than a plain signed comparison,
// which would silently test a different (symmetric, and wrong) window.
//
// **A second, unrelated real bug found and fixed by inspection before
// ever compiling**: `Ghost.cpp`'s own `CanMove()` bounds-checks a
// candidate cell with `if (mapX >= MapWidth || mapY >= MapHeight) return
// false;` - correct on real hardware only because `mapX`/`mapY` are
// unsigned `byte`s, so a leftward/upward move off the map edge wraps to a
// *large positive* value that the `>=` check still catches. This port's
// own `cavCurrentTerrain(x,y)` is the single, centralized place every
// terrain lookup in the whole file funnels through - given a genuinely
// negative coordinate (Vircon32 ints don't wrap the way AVR's unsigned
// byte does), the original `x < MapWidth` check alone would have
// incorrectly treated it as in-bounds. Fixed once, centrally, by adding
// the missing `x >= 0 && y >= 0` half of the check directly inside
// `cavCurrentTerrain()` itself - covers every caller in the file
// (Chaser's own `CanMove()` never had an explicit bounds check of its own
// at all, relying entirely on `CurrentTerrain()`'s own, so it benefits
// from this same central fix automatically). Ghost's own explicit
// early-return bounds check was *also* kept (now redundant but harmless)
// for structural fidelity with the real source.
//
// **A third real bug, in `Rock.cpp`'s own `OnHitRock()` combo-rate
// escalation, deliberately preserved rather than "fixed" except at the one
// genuinely unsafe point**: `rate` can escalate to 4 (one past the real
// 4-entry `Values[]`/`Char_Point`-offset table upstream indexes with it,
// via `if (rate < MaxRate+1)` - an upstream off-by-one that lets a single
// falling rock chain-kill enough monsters in one continuous fall to reach
// index 4). On real AVR hardware this silently over-reads a few bytes of
// adjacent PROGMEM (harmless); on Vircon32 it's a genuine out-of-bounds
// array read. The *glyph* selection (`Char_Point + (rate<<2)`) is left
// completely unclamped, since `rate=4` there just happens to land on
// `Char_Loose`'s own valid CharPattern glyph data (an in-bounds, if
// visually "wrong", reuse - a real, harmless upstream quirk, kept
// faithfully). Only the `Values[]`-equivalent score-table lookup
// (`cavPointValues[]`) is clamped to index 3, the smallest possible fix
// that removes the genuine memory-safety risk without changing anything
// a player could ever see (the score simply stops escalating past the
// table's own real 80-point cap instead of reading garbage).
//
// **Sound**: same real 3-tone-channel tracker as Cracky/Osotos
// (`Sound.cpp`), routed the same way onto `md_playTone(freqHz,
// durationSeconds)` (this engine's own genuinely multi-voice channel -
// see this project's CLAUDE.md for why that's safe here). Each melody is
// upstream's own literal [duration,note] byte-pair data, byte-diff-
// extracted via a small Python script (evaluating the real `NoteLength`/
// `Scale` enum expressions directly, not hand-computed) rather than
// transcribed by hand - `Frequencies[]`/the `Scale` enum values are
// byte-for-byte identical to Cracky's own copy (confirmed via the same
// script), reused verbatim. This game's own `Tempo` is 180 (not Cracky's
// 160), giving a slightly faster real note-advance rate
// (`(600/2)/180 ≈ 1.667` real 60Hz ticks/note, vs Cracky's `1.875`) -
// `cavNoteFrames()` uses this game's own real derived constant, not
// Cracky's. Three independent frame-stepped sequencer slots (0=one-shot
// SFX, 1=jingle/BGM-voice-A, 2=BGM-voice-B), advancing every real engine
// frame regardless of the coarser gameplay throttle above - matching
// upstream's own real structure (`SoundHandler()` runs off the same 60Hz
// SysTick as gameplay, never itself throttled by `Clock&3`).

// (the logo, "MINI", "START"/"CONTINUE", the "INUFUTO 2026" credit) lives
// at upstream's real columns 2-23, via the exact same shared PrintC()/
// PrintS() mechanism at different column arguments - not a separate,
// narrower grid. Cramming everything into the old 8-cell-wide grid (reusing
// columns that the live status labels ALSO used) is exactly what caused
// this port's own real, empirically-confirmed bugs: "START" silently

// A real, genuinely upstream bug (confirmed against Man.cpp line 68 -
// "(man.step & Movable_Status_CanMove) == 0", byte-for-byte the same wrong
// constant, not a porting artifact), found via a direct user report ("the
// level is hard to see... i see left over player drawings on the player
// previous positions"). Every other movable in this game (ghosts/chasers/
// rocks, via cavCanChangeDirection() below, matching upstream's own
// CanChangeDirection()) correctly gates its "can I read new input /
// re-validate direction now" check on (step & CAV_STEP_MASK)==0 - the man's
// own MoveMan() instead reimplements the same shape inline but reaches for
// CAV_MOVABLE_CAN_MOVE (0x08, a STATUS bit) instead of CAV_STEP_MASK (7,
// the actual step-cycle mask) - almost certainly an accidental copy/paste
// mix-up between two similarly-named-and-purposed constants, not a
// deliberate design choice (no other movable in the file does this).
// Effect: (step & 8)==0 only isolates bit 3 of the ever-incrementing step
// counter, true for steps [0-7]/[16-23]/[32-39]/... and false for
// [8-15]/[24-31]/... - so the man's own "read fresh input, re-check walls,
// refresh cavPrevMapX/Y+cavNextMapX/Y" block only actually runs on every
// OTHER real cell-crossing (every 16 steps, not every 8) instead of every
// one. On the skipped crossings, cavMoveMovable() below still silently
// advances the man one more cell in whatever direction was last decided
// (no wall re-check, no new input read) - and the post-move terrain-update
// block further down (clearing cavTerrainMap[]'s wall bits to visually
// "dig" the tunnel) unconditionally uses cavPrevMapX/Y/cavNextMapX/Y, which
// are ONLY refreshed inside this gated block - so on a skipped crossing it
// clears wall bits at whichever STALE (two cycles old) map cell those
// variables still held, not the cell actually just dug through.
// This is far more damaging here than on real hardware: upstream's own
// DrawTerrain() is a genuinely incremental single-cell redraw (a real
// SSD1306 VRAM write to one glyph, easy to miss since later real digging
// nearby redraws over it) - but this port's cavRenderVVramFromState()
// (see its own header comment) deliberately recomputes the WHOLE VVram
// grid fresh from cavTerrainMap[] every single frame, so a wrong cell's
// wall-bit clear here is baked directly into the persistent source-of-
// truth terrain state and reappears in every subsequent frame's redraw -
// exactly matching both reported symptoms (spurious cleared/dug-looking
// cells scattered off the player's real path reading as "leftover
// drawings at previous positions", and the maze's real structure getting
// progressively corrupted making it "hard to see"). Fixed by routing
// through the existing, already-correct cavCanChangeDirection() helper
// instead of the ad-hoc, wrong-constant reimplementation - eliminates the
// duplicated/mistyped logic entirely rather than just swapping the one
// constant inline.

// The real bug behind the "trail of graphics garbage" report - confirmed

// left-moves showed the man's own icon accumulating at every previous
// position, never erased, exactly matching what the user described), not
// the cavMoveMan gate fix above (that one's a genuine, separate upstream
// bug, still worth keeping, but it wasn't the cause of this symptom).
//
// Map row 0 (cavTerrainMap[0..CAV_MAP_WIDTH-1], where the man starts -
// StartX/y=0) is deliberately never touched by cavComputeWallBits() or by
// upstream's own equivalent wall-bit pass, matching upstream's real
// InitTrying()/Stage.cpp exactly: both loops begin at y=1, since row 0 is a
// permanent border with no wall-bit glyph of its own to compute - it's
// simply always CAV_TERRAIN_SPACE and stays that way for the whole stage
// (confirmed: nothing else in this file ever mutates cavTerrainMap[0..11]
// after cavInitTrying()'s own initial `= CAV_TERRAIN_SPACE` loop).
// Upstream gets away with never redrawing that row on its own because its
// real VVram is an incremental Front/Back double-buffer - DrawAll() calls
// VVramBackToFront(), a full-buffer memcpy that unconditionally restores
// row 0's own VVramFront content back to whatever blank glyph VVramBack
// still holds there (set once by ClearVVram() at stage start, never
// touched again), erasing any sprite previously stamped there, *before*
// DrawSprites() re-stamps the current frame's real positions on top - so a
// moving sprite's own trail is wiped every single real frame regardless of
// which row it's in.
// This port's own "recompute the whole grid fresh from cavTerrainMap[]
// every frame" shortcut (see this file's own header comment) is a faithful
// substitute for that *only* for the rows the terrain loop below actually
// visits (map rows 1..CAV_MAP_HEIGHT-1) - it was never extended to also
// cover map row 0, since row 0 never needed a wall-bit *glyph* computed.
// But glyph computation and frame-to-frame VVram refresh are two different
// concerns that upstream's own architecture happens to bundle behind the
// same "row 0 is never DrawTerrain()'d" fact - this port only replicated
// the first half. The result: nothing ever resets whatever a sprite
// (chiefly the man, who starts and often walks along exactly this row)
// last stamped into VVram rows 1-2 (map row 0's own two doubled rows), so
// each new position just accumulates on top of every previous one,
// forever, in a genuinely different mechanism from a per-tick corruption
// (which would need a fresh mistaken write each move) - here nothing writes
// anything wrong at all, something that upstream relies on happening
// (a full-row refresh) simply never happens for this one row.
// Fixed by including map row 0 in this same per-frame terrain recompute
// loop (y starts at 0, not 1) instead of adding a second, separate
// "blank out row 0" step - cavTerrainMap[0..11] is always CAV_TERRAIN_SPACE
// with no wall bits ever set, so codesOffset always resolves to 0 and every
// one of its 4 glyphs is CAV_CHAR_WALL_SPACE (blank) - exactly reproducing
// upstream's own "always blank unless a sprite is currently there" result,
// just via a fresh recompute instead of a buffer-copy.

// **Rewritten after the same real hardware-photo-driven fix already applied
// to gameCracky.c** (see that file's own header comment on `crkBeginTitle`
// for the full story) - re-reading upstream's real `Status.cpp` (`Title()`)
// line by line shows the original diagnosis (title text colliding with the
// live status labels, so it had to be trimmed/relocated/dropped to fit) was
// backwards: none of that text ever collides with anything upstream,
// because upstream's own Vram address space is a genuinely wide 32-char-
// cell-per-page canvas (see cavStatusChar's own header comment) - the
// status labels occupy only columns 24-31 (upstream's own `LeftX=24`), and
// every piece of title-screen text sits at columns 2-23, well clear of
// them. The ROOT problem was this port's own `cavStatusChar` being modeled
// as an 8-column-wide grid in the first place - now fixed there, this
// function places everything at upstream's real, literal columns, with
// `cavFullWidthText=true` so cavComposeRawByte() renders the full canvas
// instead of just the narrow status zone. This directly fixes two real,
// empirically-confirmed bugs from the old narrow-grid model: "START"
// silently overwriting the live "TIME" value's own first digit (found via
// live testing: showed "START 0" instead of a clean "START" / "TIME  0"
// split), and "MINI" overwriting "STAGE" (both collisions simply don't
// exist once each piece of text sits at its own real, non-overlapping
// column range).
//
// **A second architectural fix, applied afterward, once the same underlying
// mistake was found and corrected in gameCracky.c's own reference port
// first**: the "CAVIT" wordmark below was originally drawn as small plain
// text (`sCavit`, reasoned at the time as "purely decorative, matching
// Cracky's own identical simplification") - wrong, for the exact same
// reason it was wrong there: it's upstream's own real, biggest, most
// prominent title-screen element (a hand-authored 20x4-VVram-cell pixel-art
// bitmap, `Status.cpp`'s `Title()`'s own `TitleBytes[]`), not a throwaway
// detail. Restored here to draw the real bitmap logo directly into
// `cavVVram` from `cavTitleBytes[]`, at its own real position (VVram rows
// 2-5, columns `TitleLeft`..`TitleLeft+19` where `TitleLeft=(24-4*5)/2=2` -
// matching upstream's own `VVramFront + VVramWidth*2 + TitleLeft` starting
// offset exactly, i.e. real hardware pages 1-2). `cavComposeRawByte()` was
// updated to OR-combine this VVram content with `cavStatusChar`'s own text
// layer rather than choosing one exclusively (see that function's own
// comment) - safe since the logo (columns 2-21) and every status-text
// element (columns 24+) occupy disjoint column ranges even on the one page
