// =============================================================================
// HOPMAN (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306+CH32V003 "cate" engine, license "None
// specified" - GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_hopman`) - a
// side-scrolling platformer: jump between floors and needles across a wide
// (96-column, 3-floor) horizontally-scrolling stage, riding lifts and
// dodging patrolling monsters, to reach a goal marker far to the right while
// collecting items along the way for bonus points. 8 hand-authored stages,
// 3 lives, no persistent hi-score (upstream itself has this commented out -
// `// word HiScore;` - a genuinely disabled feature, not something this port
// dropped).
//
// Same author/engine family as this project's own already-shipped Cracky
// port (`gameCracky.c`) - read in full as the reference implementation for
// this port, per direct instruction. Real SSD1306 display streamed one raw
// byte at a time (`SendOledData()`), the same byte-per-(column,page) model
// `md_drawColumn()` already handles, and a real explicit 60Hz SysTick frame
// limiter (`Timer.cpp`'s own `kTimerHz=60`) - same as Cracky, no AVR-style
// "silently N times too fast" risk despite the CH32V003/RISC-V host.
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform is needed, matching Cracky's
// own final, hard-won conclusion** (see that file's own header comment for
// the debugging saga that established this) - `hopComposeRawByte(col,page)`
// is drawn directly at its own `(col,page)` via plain `md_drawColumn()`, no
// mirroring, no per-bit reversal, no lookup table.
//
// **Rendering reuses Cracky's exact two-level tile system**: a 24x16 logical
// glyph-index grid (`hopVVram`, `VVramWidth==WindowWidth==24`) is packed into
// real screen bytes via a 2-byte-per-glyph `CharPattern` lookup and the same
// nibble-interleaving derived in Cracky (`hopComposeRawByte()`'s own
// sub-0/1/2/3 branches, upper/lower from two vertically-stacked VVram rows).
// The one genuine structural difference from Cracky: **this stage is much
// wider than the screen and scrolls** - the real map is 96 columns x 2 (a
// `StageWidth` of 192 x-units) x 3 floors, addressed via a 2-bit-per-cell
// `CellMap` (`Cell_Space/Cell_Floor/Cell_Item/Cell_Needle`), and only a
// 24-VVram-cell-wide window (`hopLeftX..hopLeftX+23`) is visible at once -
// `hopMapToVVram()` is a direct structural mirror of upstream's own
// `MapToVVram()` (its own scroll-offset/byte-boundary math kept exactly as
// upstream computes it, not re-derived), and `hopScroll()` recenters the
// window on the player every time they move horizontally or ride a lift,
// matching `Stage.cpp`'s own `Scroll()` exactly.
//
// **Movable coordinates are genuine pixel-scale x/y** (not VVram-cell-
// degenerate like Cracky's own `CoordShift=0` case) - `Movable{x,y,sprite}`
// has no `dx/dy/status` fields at all here (those live on `Man`/`Monster`/
// `Lift` individually), and `ShowSprite()`'s own `x = pMovable->x - LeftX`
// relies on real AVR `byte` (uint8_t) wraparound to detect "scrolled off
// the left edge" (a huge wrapped value fails the `<VVramWidth` check) - the
// exact "AVR-implicit-narrow-type-reliance" bug family this project has
// hit repeatedly elsewhere. Ported with a direct, explicit sign check
// instead (`x>=0 && x<HOP_VVRAM_WIDTH`) rather than reproducing the
// wraparound trick, matching this project's own standing practice.
//
// **A real, deliberate gravity/jump physics model** (`Man.dx/dy`, a
// three-tick rising jump `dy=-3,-2,-1` decaying toward 0 via +1/tick
// gravity, then falling `dy=+1,+2,+3,...` until a floor or a lift is
// found) - ported as a direct, careful line-by-line translation of
// `Man.cpp`'s own `MoveMan()`, preserving every exact nuance: horizontal
// movement only updates `dx`/the facing `pattern` when `CanMoveX()`
// actually succeeds (a blocked direction press doesn't even turn the
// sprite to face that way, matching upstream exactly); landing on a lift
// mid-fall (`FindLift()`) takes priority over landing on a floor; the
// jump-animation frame (`pattern+4`) happens to alias the same glyph index
// as each direction's own first walk-cycle frame (`Man_Left0`/
// `Man_Right0`), a real upstream quirk preserved rather than "corrected".
//
// **Monsters are simple, deterministic left-right patrollers** (no chase
// AI, unlike Cracky's own `crkDecideDirection()`) - `Monster.cpp` ported
// near-verbatim. **Lifts** (horizontal or vertical moving platforms,
// `Lift.cpp`) are a genuinely new mechanic Cracky doesn't have - ported
// with an index-based `hopFindLift()` (returns -1 for "not found") instead
// of upstream's own `ptr<Lift>`-or-`nullptr` return, matching this
// project's own established "resolve by id, not by real pointer" pattern
// (e.g. Tiny Dungeon's bitmap-array resolver) rather than risking an
// unproven pointer-vs-NULL comparison on this dialect.
//
// **A genuine dual-rate throttle, decoded precisely from `Main.cpp`'s own
// `Clock`-gated `do`/`while` loop rather than guessed**: the raw loop runs
// essentially unthrottled except for one real blocking `WaitTimer(10)`
// call, which only fires once every 4 raw iterations (`Clock&3==0`) - so
// the *effective* real-world "one full logic tick" period is exactly 10
// real 60Hz ticks (~166ms), reproduced here as a plain whole-function tick
// divisor, `HOP_TICK_DIVISOR=10`, gating `hopUpdatePlaying()`'s entire
// body (input/physics/redraw together) the same way this project's own
// NumberPlace/HollowSeeker/t2048/Doc/Pacman/Pipe/Tiny-Mania throttles do.
// Lift movement is additionally gated to only every *other* logic tick
// (`Clock&7==0`, true on alternating quanta since `Clock` increases by 4
// each real tick) - reproduced with a simple `hopLiftPhase` boolean
// toggled once per logic tick, rather than needing to replicate the exact
// numeric `Clock` value.
//
// **Sound**: the same real 3-tone-channel software mixer/tracker shape as
// Cracky's own `Sound.cpp` (a different `Tempo=180` here, vs Cracky's 160,
// giving a slightly different real note-duration-per-tick formula,
// `hopNoteFrames(length) = round(length*(300/180)+0.5)`), routed the same
// way onto `md_playTone()`/`md_stopTone()` with 3 independent frame-
// stepped sequencer slots (0=one-shot SFX, 1=jingle/BGM-voice-A reused
// exactly like Cracky's own channel-1 reuse, 2=BGM-voice-B), advanced
// every real engine frame regardless of `HOP_TICK_DIVISOR`. Every melody
// table (`Sound_Loose/Hit/Beep/Bonus/Start/Clear/GameOver`, `StartBGM`'s
// own two simultaneous voices) was extracted programmatically from the
// real upstream source (resolving the `NoteLength`/`Scale` enum constants
// and the one `N8+N2` arithmetic expression via a small Python evaluator),
// not hand-transcribed, matching this project's own "byte-diff transcribed
// tables" discipline. `crkMelodyLength()`'s own Cracky equivalent turned
// out to be genuine dead code (defined but never actually called anywhere
// in `crkAdvanceOneSeq()`, which only ever uses the terminator values 0/255
// to know when to stop/loop) - confirmed the same holds here and skipped
// porting the equivalent function entirely, rather than reproducing
// unreachable code.
//
// **The title screen's own real "HOPMAN" logo is a genuine raw-VVram
// pixel-art bitmap (`hopTitleBytes[]`, drawn in `hopBeginTitle()`), not
// decorative text** - an earlier version of this port had replaced it with
// plain status-column text, reasoning it was "purely decorative"; that
// turned out to be the same wrong call Cracky's own port initially made for
// its identical "CRACKY" logo (see `gameCracky.c`'s own header comment for
// the full debugging saga that established this) - it's the single
// biggest, most prominent element on the whole title screen, not a
// throwaway detail, and the real bitmap has its own dedicated per-letter
// pixel data with no dependency on the shared small status-text font at
// all. **Fixed to match Cracky's own restored logo exactly**: see
// `hopTitleBytes`'s own header comment (data table section) and
// `hopBeginTitle()`'s own comment (state machine section) for the full
// derivation and drawing-loop details, and `hopComposeRawByte()`'s own
// comment for how the resulting VVram content is OR-combined with the
// status-text layer rather than one excluding the other. This also means
// the title word no longer needs `hopAsciiPattern`'s own hand-added 'H'
// glyph workaround (see that table's own header comment, and finding #1
// below) - that glyph is left in place regardless, in case some other
// status text elsewhere in this file still needs it, but the title word
// itself is now a real pixel-art bitmap that never touches the reduced
// 27-glyph status font at all.
//
// **A real architectural bug, found and fixed after the fact via a real
// user-supplied photo of Cracky running on actual hardware** (see
// `gameCracky.c`'s own header comment, `crkStatusChar`/`crkFullWidthText`/
// `crkBeginTitle`, for the full writeup - this section only covers what
// changed here). The photo proved upstream's real `PrintC()`/`PrintS()`
// text mechanism writes to a genuinely 32-character-cell-wide row (128
// real pixels / VramStep=4), not just the narrow 8-cell status-label slice
// (`LeftX=24`..31) this port originally modeled `hopStatusChar` as. The
// title screen's own text (the logo, "MINI", "START"/"CONTINUE", the
// credit line) all live at upstream's real columns 8-23 - genuinely
// different real estate than the status labels, not a cramped overlap
// needing truncation/relocation. The original design here avoided Cracky's
// exact overflow/clobber symptoms only by *also* dropping real content to
// fit (not calling `hopPrintStatus()` first, matching upstream's own real
// `Title()`, which does; truncating "CONTINUE" to "CONTINU") - a real gap,
// not a correct alternative design, once the true column budget was
// understood. **Fixed** the same way as Cracky: `hopStatusChar` widened to
// `[8][32]`; `hopPrintScore()`/`hopPrintTime()`/`hopPrintStatus()` now use
// upstream's real `LeftX`-relative columns (24, 26, 29, 30) instead of a
// local 0-7 offset; a new `hopFullWidthText` flag (true only during
// `HOP_STATE_TITLE`) makes `hopComposeRawByte()` read the full 0-31
// char-cell range from `hopStatusChar` instead of splitting between VVram
// (map) and the narrow status slice; and `hopBeginTitle()` now calls
// `hopPrintStatus()` first (matching upstream's real `Title()` exactly)
// and places every title-screen string at upstream's own real, literal
// columns - "HOPMAN" logo text at page 2 col 0 (simplified placement, no
// exact upstream bitmap position to preserve), "MINI" at page 3 col 19,
// "START"/"CONTINUE" (now the full 8-character word, no longer truncated)
// at page 5/6 col 9 with the cursor at col 8, and the credit line restored
// to upstream's real single-line "INUFUTO 2026" (previously split across
// two separate, differently-positioned calls) at page 7 col 12 - all
// genuinely clear of the status labels' own columns 24-31, so nothing
// needs trimming, relocating, or dropping anymore.
//
// **A dedicated post-ship verification pass** (this game was originally
// ported in a large parallel batch and only test-compiled, never played) -
// re-derived every data table programmatically from the real upstream
// source via a small Python script and byte-diffed it against this file's
// own copy (`hopAsciiPattern`/`hopCharPattern`/`hopCellChars`/every one of
// the 8 stages' `itemCount`/`monsterCount`/`liftCount`/monster-triple/
// lift-pair/72-byte cell-map tables/all 9 sound melodies including both
// simultaneous `StartBGM()` voices) - all matched byte-for-byte on the
// first pass, no transcription errors found anywhere in the data. Traced
// the entire state machine (title -> start jingle -> playing -> lose-
// anim -> retry-or-gameover-jingle -> title, plus clear-wait -> clear-
// jingle -> bonus-tally -> perfect-tally -> next stage) line-by-line
// against `Main.cpp`'s own real `goto`-chained loop, including the exact
// `Clock&3`/`Clock&7` tick-and-lift-phase cadence and every non-zero
// upstream global initializer. Found and fixed two real bugs:
//
// 1) **A genuine rendering bug, caught immediately from the very first
// live screenshot**: the title screen showed "OPMAN" instead of "HOPMAN"
// - the leading 'H' silently rendered as a blank space. Root cause:
// `hopAsciiPattern`/`hopAsciiIndex()` are a byte-for-byte-verified copy
// of upstream's own real, reduced 27-glyph status-text font
// (`" 0123456789>ACEFGIMNOPRSTUV"`, `Chars.cpp`) - which genuinely has
// **no 'H' at all**. Upstream itself never hits this gap, because its
// own `Title()` draws "HOPMAN" as a hand-authored raw-VVram bitmap logo
// (`TitleBytes[]`, `Status.cpp`), never through this text font at all -
// but this port's own header comment above (see "the title screen's
// decorative logo... was simplified... replaced with plain status-column
// text") replaced that bitmap logo with plain `hopPrintS()` calls,
// hitting the one letter the reduced font doesn't have, for the one
// string that happens to need it most (the game's own name). **Fixed**
// by appending a 29th (0-indexed 27th) glyph - an 'H' built the same
// two-full-verticals-plus-a-middle-crossbar shape already used by this
// same font's own 'A'/'8' glyphs (whose existing bit-for-row-2 pattern
// already establishes "row 2 = the vertical center" for a horizontal
// stroke) - appended at the *end* of both `hopAsciiPattern` and
// `hopAsciiIndex()`'s own search table, not inserted alphabetically, so
// no existing character's index shifts. Verified via a Python simulation
// of the exact composite-byte math (rendering the glyph as ASCII art)
// before ever rebuilding, then confirmed live via Puppeteer that the
// title screen now correctly reads "HOPMAN".
// **Superseded, later in the same session** (see this file's own top-level
// header comment and `hopTitleBytes`/`hopBeginTitle()`): the real "HOPMAN"
// title wordmark was itself restored as upstream's own genuine raw-VVram
// bitmap logo rather than plain text, so the title word no longer routes
// through `hopAsciiPattern`/`hopAsciiIndex()` at all and this specific 'H'
// gap can no longer affect it. The appended 'H' glyph itself is left in
// place exactly as fixed here (harmless, and may still matter for some
// other status-text string elsewhere in this file) - this bug's own root
// cause and fix are kept as real project history, not because the title
// screen still depends on the workaround today.
//
// 2) **A real timing bug in `hopUpdatePerfectTally()`**: upstream's own
// per-item "PERFECT" bonus loop is `AddScore(10); Sound_Bonus();
// WaitTimer(30);` - `Sound_Bonus()` is a non-blocking `StartMelody()`
// call (channel 0, 6 notes), so the loop's real pacing comes entirely
// from the *independent*, fixed `WaitTimer(30)` call (the melody plays
// concurrently in the background, finishing in ~13 real frames, well
// inside that 30-frame gate) - not from the melody's own play length.
// This port's own wait-frame value was `hopNoteFrames(1)*6 + 30 = 42`,
// incorrectly treating this like the genuinely *blocking* `Sound_Beep()`
// case in the tally loop just above it (`hopUpdateBonusTally()`, where
// the wait genuinely must equal the note's real duration, since
// `Sound_Beep()` is `WaitMelody`) - stretching every "PERFECT" bonus
// tick from upstream's real 30-real-frame pace out to 42, a ~40% slowdown
// across up to 21 ticks on the largest stage. **Fixed** to the literal
// upstream constant, `hopWaitFrames = 30;`.
//
// Both fixes were verified via a full rebuild and an isolated Puppeteer/
// WebGL test instance (own copy of the WebBuild folder, own HTTP port,
// per this project's own established multi-agent-safe testing practice -
// note two stale/duplicate `python -m http.server` processes were found
// bound to the same test port mid-session, from an earlier restart
// attempt that hadn't actually released the port; killed by PID and
// re-served from a fresh port once diagnosed, since the stale server was
// intermittently serving an old debug build and made one screenshot look
// like a rendering regression that wasn't real). Confirmed live: the
// title screen now reads "HOPMAN" correctly; menu -> launch -> title ->
// Fire-to-start -> start jingle -> active gameplay all transition
// correctly; the scroll window (`hopLeftX`/`hopScroll()`) correctly
// tracks the player and reveals more of the map, including a vertical
// lift and additional floors, as the player moves right; horizontal
// movement is correctly blocked at a needle cell (`hopCanMoveX()`)
// without killing the player, while jumping over one and continuing
// works; falling off the bottom of the lowest floor correctly ends the
// life (`hopMan.status &= ~HOP_MAN_LIVE`) and triggers a full stage
// retry (`hopBeginTrying()` correctly resets `hopStageTime`/player
// position/map/sprites). A temporary on-screen debug readout (printing
// `hopRemainCount`/`hopState` to an otherwise-unused status row during
// gameplay, since this game's own lives display is intentionally blank
// - see the "lives-remaining" note below) confirmed, across a live
// death-and-retry sequence, that `hopRemainCount` correctly decrements
// 3->2->1->0 across three real deaths, that each non-terminal death
// correctly re-enters `HOP_STATE_START_JINGLE` (matching upstream's
// `goto try_;`), and that the terminal death correctly reaches
// `HOP_STATE_GAMEOVER_JINGLE` with the "GAME OVER" overlay text rendered
// correctly, positioned exactly where upstream's own `PrintGameOver()`
// places it - the debug readout was fully removed again afterward
// (confirmed via a project-wide grep) before the final rebuild.
//
// **Checked and confirmed correct, not just skipped**: the lives-
// remaining status display (`hopPrintStatus()`'s own `hopRemainCount`
// block) draws blank space characters rather than any visible glyph or
// digit when `RemainCount` is 2 or 3 - this looks like it ought to be a
// bug (no on-screen indication of spare lives at all), but is a byte-
// for-byte match of this project's own already-shipped Cracky port's
// identical simplification of the same upstream `Put2C(Char_Remain)`
// icon-row mechanic (see `gameCracky.c`'s own `crkPrintStatus()`) -
// left as-is rather than "fixed" unilaterally, since it's a deliberate,
// already-established sibling precedent, not a Hopman-specific
// transcription error. Also checked and confirmed correct: the title
// screen's own held-direction-key selection-toggle behavior (pressing
// Fire while the title-screen's own arrow selection responds to an
// *already-held* direction key from before the screen was entered,
// since neither this port's `hopPrevLeft/Right/Up/Down` reset nor
// upstream's own real `Title()` loop have any equivalent debounce for
// this specific transition) - traced directly against upstream's real
// `while(true){ ...; if (key&Keys_Dir) { ...toggle...; while(ScanKeys()
// !=0); } }` and confirmed this is a genuine, faithfully-reproduced
// upstream quirk, not a porting defect. Also traced (and found provably
// unreachable, not a live bug) a theoretical `hopGetCellAtFloor()`
// column+1 overflow past the 96-column map at the stage's own far-right
// edge - the player's own real max-reachable X (190, blocked by
// `hopCanMoveX()`'s own `newX >= StageWidth-1` check) never lands on the
// one odd-X value that would trigger it.
//
// **Not independently verified live**: a genuine stage-clear (reaching
// `HOP_GOAL_X`/`HOP_GOAL_Y`) and the resulting `HOP_STATE_CLEAR_WAIT` ->
// `_CLEAR_JINGLE` -> `_BONUS_TALLY` -> `_PERFECT_TALLY` sequence -
// stage 0 alone needs 7 items collected and a genuine ~189-unit
// traversal past multiple lifts/monsters, well beyond what a scripted,
// unskilled automated playthrough reasonably reaches in a single
// session. The state machine and data for this whole sequence were
// still verified line-by-line against upstream (`Main.cpp`'s own
// post-`while(!Cleared)` code) and the one real bug found there (the
// `hopUpdatePerfectTally()` timing miscalculation above) was fixed -
// worth a direct check if a full stage clear is ever reached in real
// play and the pacing looks off.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// AsciiPattern - " 0123456789>ACEFGIMNOPRSTUV", 4 bytes/glyph, used for
// status text (SCORE/STAGE/TIME/lives/title/GAME OVER/etc). Byte-identical
// to Cracky's own copy of this same font (same author/engine family), and
// in turn byte-identical to upstream's own real `AsciiTable`/`AsciiPattern`
// (Chars.cpp) - a genuinely reduced 27-glyph set with **no 'H' at all**.
// Upstream itself never needs one: its own Title() draws "HOPMAN" as a
// hand-authored raw-VVram bitmap logo (`TitleBytes[]`, Status.cpp), never
// through this text font. This port's own title screen (see this file's
// own header comment) deliberately replaces that bitmap logo with plain
// status-column text instead, matching Cracky's own established
// simplification for this exact game family - but doing that for THIS
// game's own name specifically hits the one letter the reduced font
// doesn't have: printing "HOPMAN" through hopPrintS()/hopAsciiIndex()
// silently mapped 'H' to the "not found" fallback (index 0 = a blank
// space), rendering the title as "OPMAN" - confirmed via a live Puppeteer
// screenshot showing exactly that missing leading letter. Fixed by
// appending a 29th... (28th, 0-indexed 27) glyph, an 'H' built the same
// two-full-verticals-plus-a-middle-crossbar shape as this font's own
// existing 'A'/'8' (whose glyphs already establish "bit for row 2 = the
// vertical-center row" for a horizontal stroke) - appended at the END of
// both the search table and this data array (not inserted alphabetically)
// so no existing character's own index shifts.

// "CONTINU", `hopPrintStatus()` was never called at all (to avoid the

// upstream's real single "INUFUTO 2026" line. Re-reading upstream's real

// none of that text ever collides with anything upstream, because
// upstream's own Vram address space is a genuinely wide 32-char-cell-per-

// occupy only columns 24-31 (upstream's own `LeftX=24`), and every piece
// of title-screen text sits at columns 8-23, well clear of them. The ROOT
// problem was this port's own `hopStatusChar` being modeled as an
// 8-column-wide grid in the first place - now fixed there, this function
