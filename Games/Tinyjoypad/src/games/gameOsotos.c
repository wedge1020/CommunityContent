// OSOTOS mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, license "None specified" -
// GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_osotos`) - a Boulder-Dash/
// Sokoban-flavored puzzle-chase: walk a 12-column x 8-row stage collecting
// every star ("item"); press Fire while facing a block to push it - a pushed
// block slides until it hits a wall/other block/edge (destroying it) or
// falls off a ledge onto a monster below (killing the monster and scoring a
// combo-multiplied bonus). A block pushed off the map or crushed against a
// wall "dies" but silently revives at its original position a few ticks
// later ("消えたブロックは元の場所に復活します" - readme.md). Collect every
// star to clear a stage; 8 hand-authored stages, 3 lives, real persistent
// hi-score tracked in-session only (upstream itself has NO EEPROM/hi-score
// tracking at all - its own `HiScore` global and every reference to it are
// commented out in `Main.cpp`; this port simply carries no hi-score either,
// matching upstream's own real shipped behavior rather than adding one).
// Same CH32V003 RISC-V + SSD1306, same real 60Hz SysTick frame limiter
// (`Timer.cpp`'s `kTimerHz=60`, `WaitTimer(t)`) as the sibling `gameCracky.c`
// port this file was built from - see that file's own header for the
// methodology this port follows throughout. Only 4 directions + 1 action
// button (`ScanKeys.h`'s `Keys_Button0`), a strict subset of what
// `tinyJoypadShim.h` already exposes - `isFire2Pressed()` goes unused here.
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform is applied, on purpose** -
// `crkComposeRawByte(col,page)`'s sibling in this file, `osoComposeRawByte`,
// draws directly at its own `(col,page)` with no mirror/flip/bit-reversal.
// This exact "does this game's `InitOled()` need a software orientation fix"
// question was already investigated at length for `gameCracky.c` (see its
// own header) and settled definitively via a real user-supplied reference
// photo: UIAPduino's own `SegRemap`/`ComScanDec` register writes exist to
// correct a *physical panel-mounting* quirk on that specific breakout
// module, with nothing to correct for in a from-scratch software
// recreation. `Oled.cpp` here uses the identical two commands for the
// identical reason - not re-investigated from scratch, just carried over
// directly from that already-settled finding.
//
// **Rendering is the same two-level VVram/Vram tile system as Cracky, ported
// the same way (a direct structural mirror, not re-derived into a closed
// form)** - `VVram` is a 24-wide x 18-tall logical glyph-index grid
// (`osoVVram`; taller than Cracky's 16 rows - see below for why), packed
// into real SSD1306 bytes via the identical `SendUL()` nibble-interleave
// (`osoComposeRawByte`, copied structurally from `crkComposeRawByte` since
// `CharPattern`'s own 2-bytes-per-glyph layout and the nibble-mixing formula
// are byte-for-byte the same "Cate engine" convention in both games).
// Upstream's own dirty-tracking `Backup[]` buffer (skip resending unchanged
// real I2C bytes) is dropped, matching Cracky's own precedent and this
// project's standing "always redraw the full frame" rule.
//
// **A genuine, load-bearing 1-row vertical crop, found by tracing
// `VVramToVram()`'s own pointer arithmetic rather than assumed**: its scan
// starts at `VVram + VVramWidth` (row 1, not row 0) and each of the 8 real
// hardware pages reads VVram rows `(2*page+1)` and `(2*page+2)` - so VVram's
// own row 0 (the very top of `DrawBackground()`'s own grid, floor 0's own
// "is there a ceiling above" indicator row - always blank in practice, since
// floor 0 is the topmost floor and nothing is ever drawn above it) is never
// actually sent to the display, and one extra row (16, a synthetic all-floor
// row `DrawBackground()` writes right after its 4-floor x 4-row grid, "the
// ground beneath the lowest floor") becomes visible as page 7's own lower
// half instead. `VVramHeight` is declared `16+2` (18) specifically to give
// `DrawSprites()`'s own per-row bound check (`y < VVramHeight`) one row of
// headroom past the last genuinely-visible row (16) without ever indexing
// out of the flat array. Reproduced exactly: `osoComposeRawByte()` reads
// `osoVVram[page*2+1]`/`[page*2+2]` (not `[page*2]`/`[page*2+1]` the way
// Cracky's own, un-cropped VVram does), and `osoDrawSpriteInto2x2()` bound-
// checks against the same `OSO_VVRAM_HEIGHT` (18)/`OSO_VVRAM_WIDTH` (24)
// upstream's own `DrawSprites()` does.
//
// **The title screen's own text layout was rewritten after the exact same
// architectural bug found (via a real user-supplied hardware photo) in the
// sibling `gameCracky.c` was traced into this file too - see that file's
// own header comment and CLAUDE.md's "A real user-supplied hardware photo
// overturns Cracky's own title-screen design" section for the full
// discovery story.** The root cause here is identical: upstream's real
// `PrintC()`/`PrintS()` write to a genuine 32-character-cell-wide Vram row
// (128 real pixels / `VramStep`=4), not an 8-cell one - `Status.cpp`'s own
// `LeftX=24` constant confines SCORE/STAGE/TIME/lives to columns 24-31, but
// every piece of `Title()`'s own text ("MINI" at column 17, "START"/
// "CONTINUE" at column 9 with the cursor at column 8, "INUFUTO 2026" at
// column 12) lives at columns well inside what's the map area during real
// gameplay - the *same* shared `PrintC()`/`PrintS()` mechanism, just at
// different column arguments, not a separate narrow zone. Upstream's own
// "MINI" is additionally drawn relative to the real 80-value logo bitmap's
// own computed position - `TitleLeft + 4*TitleLength - 5` (`TitleLeft=
// OSO_TITLE_LEFT=2`, `TitleLength=OSO_TITLE_LENGTH=5`) - which resolves to
// column 17.
//
// This port's own `osoStatusChar` was originally modeled as an 8-column-wide
// grid (`int[8][8]`, matching only the status labels' own real range) with
// `osoComposeRawByte()` additionally *subtracting* the map width from
// `rawCol` to force every status-grid read into that same narrow local 0-7
// range - so title-screen text had nowhere to go but that same cramped
// 8-column zone the status labels already needed, and "MINI"/"START" ended
// up sharing one cell outright (see bug #1 in the verification-pass list
// below - a real collision this fix supersedes, not just documents).
// **Fixed** the same way as Cracky: `osoStatusChar` widened to `int[8][32]`,
// every `osoPrintStatus()`/`osoPrintScore()`/`osoPrintTime()` column
// argument updated to upstream's own real `LeftX=24`-based columns, a new
// `osoFullWidthText` flag (true only in `OSO_STATE_TITLE`) lets
// `osoComposeRawByte()` read the full 0-31 column range (via a direct
// `rawCol/4`, no more local-offset subtraction) instead of just columns
// 24-31 while the title screen is showing, and `osoBeginTitle()` now places
// every element at upstream's own literal columns - "MINI" restored (page 3,
// col 17), "START"/"CONTINUE" moved to their real columns (page 5/6, col 9,
// cursor at col 8 on both), "CONTINUE" spelled out in full (8 letters, no
// longer truncated to "CONTINU"), and the "INUFUTO 2026" credit line
// restored (page 7, col 12) - none of it collides with SCORE/STAGE/TIME/
// lives' own columns 24-31, so nothing needs to be dropped, truncated, or
// relocated onto an already-occupied cell anymore.
//
// **A second, related architectural bug found and fixed the same session
// this port's own `crkComposeRawByte()`/`crkBeginTitle()` sibling in
// `gameCracky.c` was fixed a second time**: the purely-decorative-looking
// 80-value logo *bitmap* had been simplified to plain "OSOTOS" text (page
// 2, col 0) at initial port time, on the same reasoning Cracky's own logo
// once used ("purely decorative, non-gameplay-relevant") - wrong for the
// same reason it was wrong there: it's upstream's actual title wordmark,
// the single biggest, most prominent element on the whole title screen,
// not a throwaway detail. **Fixed** by adding `osoTitleBytes[80]`
// (byte-diff-extracted via script from `Status.cpp`'s own real
// `TitleBytes[]`, confirmed 80 values = `OSO_TITLE_LENGTH`(5) letters x 16)
// and drawing it directly into `osoVVram` at VVram row 2, starting column
// `OSO_TITLE_LEFT` (matching upstream's own `VVram + VVramWidth*2 +
// TitleLeft` starting offset exactly), the same structural-mirror loop
// shape as Cracky's own fix. `osoCharPattern[]`'s own first 32 bytes (the
// "logo" glyph range every value in `osoTitleBytes` indexes into) were
// independently re-verified byte-for-byte against the real upstream
// `Chars.cpp` via the same script before trusting them - confirmed
// unchanged and correct, no fix needed there. `osoComposeRawByte()` was
// updated the same way as Cracky's own fix: OR-combines the VVram-derived
// `mapByte` with the status-text-derived `textByte` instead of choosing
// one exclusively, since the logo (real hardware pages 0-2) and the status
// text (pages 0/3/5/6/7) occupy disjoint page ranges by construction - see
// that function's own comment for the full reasoning, including why this
// is a no-op change for every real-gameplay column. No separate cleanup
// was needed at the title->gameplay transition: `osoInitTrying()`/
// `osoBeginTrying()` already rebuild the whole `osoVVram` grid fresh via
// `osoDrawAll()`/`osoMapToVVram()` every real gameplay frame (the same
// "always redraw the full frame" model this whole port already follows,
// see this file's own header above), so the logo's own VVram rows are
// naturally overwritten the instant real gameplay begins, with no leftover
// logo pixels bleeding into the map area.
//
// **The blocking upstream control flow rewritten as an explicit frame-
// stepped state machine**, the same treatment as every port in this
// project: OSO_STATE_TITLE, OSO_STATE_START_JINGLE (the blocking
// `Sound_Start()` held before play begins, then `StartBGM()`),
// OSO_STATE_PLAYING, OSO_STATE_LOSE_ANIM (`LooseMan()`'s own 8-step blink-
// and-beep loop), OSO_STATE_GAMEOVER_JINGLE, OSO_STATE_CLEAR_WAIT_A (the
// real `WaitTimer(30)` held before `StopBGM()`), OSO_STATE_CLEAR_WAIT_B (a
// *second*, separate `WaitTimer(10)` held after `StopBGM()` but before the
// clear jingle starts - upstream genuinely has two distinct waits with a
// real state change in between, not one combined wait, so this port keeps
// them as two distinct states rather than merging them), OSO_STATE_
// CLEAR_JINGLE, and OSO_STATE_BONUS_TALLY (the real `while(StageTime>=
// BonusRate){...Sound_Beep();}` bonus-countdown loop, converted to one
// decrement+beep per real tick, matching Cracky's own identical pattern).
//
// **Main()'s own loop structure is genuinely more involved than Cracky's**,
// worth spelling out since it drove a real, deliberate simplification:
// every real "tick" (each `WaitTimer(8)` call, gated behind `Clock&3==0`)
// actually corresponds to *4 raw loop iterations*, only one of which calls
// `WaitTimer()` at all - the other three run back-to-back with zero real
// time elapsing. Within that group, `MoveMan()`/`MoveMonsters()`/
// `UpdateBlocks()`/`UpdatePoints()` run exactly once (gated by `Clock&3==0`),
// but `MoveBlocks()` runs *twice* (gated by the looser `Clock&1==0`, so it
// fires once at the group's own start - immediately before that group's real
// `DrawAll()`+`WaitTimer(8)` - and once more, silently, during the "free"
// iterations right after the wait returns but before the *next* group's own
// processing begins). Tracing the actual coordinate math (`Movable.x/y` are
// genuine sub-cell pixel positions here, unlike Cracky's - `CellCoordMask`
// is 1, not 0 - so a block takes exactly 2 `MoveBlocks()` calls to cross one
// full stage cell) confirms this is deliberate: pushed/falling blocks slide
// at a full cell per real tick, while Man himself (`MoveMan()`, called only
// once per tick) advances only *half* a cell per tick - blocks visibly
// outrun the player once pushed, a real gameplay detail worth preserving
// exactly, not an artifact to "fix". This port reproduces the *effective*
// per-tick outcome (call `osoMoveBlocksOnce()` twice, back-to-back, then
// draw/render once) rather than replicating the precise interleaving with
// the render call sitting in between the two calls - a deliberate,
// documented simplification: the only observable difference is that every
// rendered frame here is a constant one extra half-step "ahead" of where
// upstream's own frame-boundary would sit (upstream's frame N shows
// `2N+1` cumulative block-move-calls applied; this port's frame N shows
// `2N+2`) - an unnoticeable, permanent one-half-cell-early bias in block-
// slide animation, not a growing drift, and not worth the extra state-
// machine complexity a literal reproduction (call the "hidden" second
// `MoveBlocks()` at the *start* of the *next* tick instead of the end of
// this one) would need.
//
// **Sound**: the exact same real 3-tone-channel software mixer/tracker as
// Cracky (`Sound.cpp`, byte-for-byte the same `Tempo=160`/`NoteLength`/
// `Scale` enums, the same `[duration,note]` melody byte-pair format, several
// melodies literally identical between the two games - `Sound_Start`/
// `Sound_Clear`/`Sound_GameOver`/`StartBGM`'s own `notes1`/`notes2` all
// match Cracky's own `CRK_MELODY_START`/`CLEAR`/`GAMEOVER`/`BGM1`/`BGM2`
// tables byte-for-byte, evidently shared boilerplate/composition across
// inufuto's own "Cate engine" games) - so every call here goes straight to
// `md_playTone()` the same way, reusing Cracky's exact `crkNoteFrames()`
// tempo-derivation formula (`length * 1.875`, unchanged since `Tempo=160`
// is identical) and its exact 3-slot frame-stepped sequencer shape
// (0=one-shot SFX, 1=jingle/BGM-voice-A, 2=BGM-voice-B). One real
// per-call-site difference from Cracky, checked directly against upstream
// rather than assumed identical: this game's own channel-0 cues split
// between *blocking* (`WaitMelody`: `Sound_Loose`, `Sound_Beep`) and
// *non-blocking* (`StartMelody`: `Sound_Hit`, and a genuinely new one this
// game has that Cracky doesn't, `Sound_Push`) - each call site here matches
// upstream's own choice exactly (an explicit wait-state for the two
// blocking cues, a bare fire-and-forget `osoStartSeq()` call with no wait
// for the two non-blocking ones), the same site-by-site fidelity Cracky's
// own header already documents for its own channel-0 cues.
//
// **A genuine out-of-bounds-read risk, found by inspection before ever
// compiling, not by a report**: `Point.cpp`'s `StartPoint(x,y,rate)` indexes
// a 4-entry `Values[]={10,20,40,80}` table with `rate`, and `rate` is
// literally `MovingBlock->status & Block_RateMask` - a per-block "how many
// monsters has this exact block already killed on its current slide" combo
// counter, incremented (`++pMovingBlock->status;`) every time it hits
// another monster before ever stopping. Nothing upstream caps this at 3
// (the table's own last valid index) - a single block killing a 5th monster
// mid-slide would read `Values[4]`, off the end of the real table. Harmless
// on real AVR/RISC-V flash (an adjacent-constant-data read), a genuine
// out-of-bounds array read here - the same bug shape this project has found
// and fixed many times elsewhere (e.g. Point.cpp's own upstream sibling
// games). **Fixed** with an explicit `if (rate > 3) rate = 3;` clamp right
// before the table lookup, in `osoStartPoint()`.
//
// **`HitToMan()` (`Man.cpp`) is genuinely dead code** - defined and
// declared, but never called from anywhere else in the whole source tree
// (confirmed via a full-tree grep before dropping it, the same "confirmed
// dead by grep" standard this project applies everywhere) - not ported.
// `Status.cpp`'s own `PrintPerfect()` is dead the same way (declared,
// defined, zero call sites) - also dropped.
//
// Movable coordinates (`x`,`y`) are genuine sub-cell pixel positions here
// (`CellCoordShift=1`, `CellCoordMask=1` - unlike Cracky, where the
// equivalent mask was 0 and coordinates were already whole VVram-grid
// cells) - every `CoordShift`/`CoordRate`/`CoordMask`/`CellShift`/
// `CellCoordShift`/`CellCoordMask`/`MaxTimeDenom` define is kept as the
// real upstream expression rather than silently resolved to its current
// literal value, matching Cracky's own established "#defines stay exactly
// as upstream wrote them" preference - future-proofing against a value
// this file doesn't currently need to exercise, the same reasoning Cracky's
// own header already gives for doing this.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A later, dedicated re-verification pass (triggered by this port having gone
// through two central-registration declaration-order fixes already -
// `osoAddScoreForward()`'s whole Status/Print/Sound/Score dependency chain,
// and `osoDrawAll()`'s own render chain, both relocated earlier in the file
// to be defined before their first use) re-read every real upstream source
// file line by line (not just the ones already cited above), byte-diffed
// every data table via script against the real source rather than trusting
// the original transcription, and played the rebuilt ROM live via Puppeteer.
// Found and fixed five real bugs, none related to the relocation itself
// (both relocated blocks were confirmed intact - nothing lost, duplicated,
// or reordered) - all five were pre-existing, independent transcription/
// logic slips:
//
// 1) **Title screen: "MINI" completely invisible, silently overwritten by
//    "START" every time.** `osoBeginTitle()` printed both strings at the
//    exact same (page 4, col 1) cell in this port's own compressed 8x8
//    status-text-grid title layout - the second `osoPrintS()` call
//    unconditionally clobbered the first, since this grid has no overlay/
//    z-order concept, only "last write wins". Traced the real upstream
//    `Title()` (Status.cpp) directly: MINI/START/CONTINUE/the logo are ALL
//    drawn onto the WIDE 24-column *map* area in real upstream (raw columns
//    0-95), not the narrow 8-column status area SCORE/STAGE/TIME/lives
//    share (raw columns 96-127) - so upstream never actually had this
//    collision at all, it's purely an artifact of this port's own decision
//    to cram every title element into the narrow status grid. At the time
//    this was found, **fixed** by removing the `sMini` print call and its
//    string entirely, for lack of anywhere collision-free to put it in the
//    then-8-column-wide grid. **Superseded by a later, deeper fix** (see
//    this file's own header comment, above) once the real root cause - the
//    grid being modeled as 8 columns wide at all, rather than the genuine
//    32-column-wide canvas upstream actually has - was found via a real
//    user-supplied hardware photo of the sibling `gameCracky.c` port:
//    `osoStatusChar` was widened to `int[8][32]` and "MINI" was restored at
//    its own real upstream column (page 3, col 17), no longer needing to be
//    dropped at all.
// 2) **`osoMelodyLoose` played the "lose a life" cue a full octave too
//    high.** Used `OSO_A4` (440Hz); the real upstream `Sound_Loose()`
//    (Sound.cpp) uses `A3` (220Hz) - almost certainly because `OSO_A3`
//    simply didn't exist as a `#define` yet when this table was first
//    written (every other melody in the file only ever needed octave-4-
//    and-up notes). **Fixed** by adding `OSO_A3`/`OSO_F3`/`OSO_G3`/`OSO_B3`
//    defines and switching this table to `OSO_A3`.
// 3) **`osoMelodyBgm2` (the second BGM voice, playing throughout every
//    stage) was a full octave too low for the entire game.** This file's
//    own earlier header text claimed BGM2 "matches Cracky's own... BGM2
//    tables byte-for-byte" - true only for BGM1 (verified via script: an
//    exact match). BGM2 is genuinely different music in the two games:
//    OSOTOS's own real `notes2[]` uses C4/E4/G4/A3/D4/F3/G3/B3, while
//    Cracky's uses the same *shape* one octave down (C3/E3/G3/A2/etc) -
//    every single one of this port's 42 raw pitch literals was exactly 12
//    semitones below the correct value, meaning the table had been
//    mechanically copied from Cracky's own file without ever being
//    checked against OSOTOS's own real Sound.cpp. Caught by a script-based
//    byte-diff against the real upstream note-by-note sequence (not by
//    ear) - every other melody table in this file diffed clean on the
//    first pass. **Fixed** by rewriting the whole table from upstream's
//    real `notes2[]`, using named mnemonics instead of raw numbers so a
//    future octave slip like this is easy to catch by eye; re-verified
//    the corrected table byte-for-byte against upstream via the same
//    script before considering it fixed.
// 4) **A real block-vs-block collision-projection bug in
//    `osoMoveBlocksOnce()`.** Upstream's own `HitToBlock(pMovingBlock)`
//    (Block.cpp) projects the calling block's NEXT position forward
//    (`x=pMovable->x+pMovable->dx; y=...+dy`) before checking for a
//    collision with another live block - this port's call hardcoded the
//    trailing dx/dy arguments to literal `0,0` instead of the block's own
//    (always dx=0, dy=OSO_COORD_RATE at this exact call site) real values,
//    checking the block's CURRENT position instead of its projected one.
//    `IsNearXY()`'s own +/-2-unit tolerance window meant this was often
//    invisible (a 1-unit shift rarely crosses the tolerance boundary), but
//    it's a real, if narrow, behavioral difference from upstream in the
//    exact boundary cases. **Fixed** by passing the block's own
//    `dx`/`dy` instead of literal zeros.
// 5) **A genuine out-of-bounds array read in `osoInitTrying()`.** Tracing
//    the real index math against `osoStageBytes[8][12]`'s own declared
//    size showed the "lower" byte group read on the very last floor
//    (floor 3) indexes 3 words past the end of the array - upstream has
//    the exact same shape (an identical pointer-walk one group past its
//    own real `bytes[12]`), harmless there (adjacent static flash, and the
//    value is provably never used - every branch that consults `lower` is
//    itself gated behind `floor < FloorCount-1`, false on floor 3) but a
//    real out-of-bounds access on Vircon32. **Fixed** by guarding the read
//    itself (skip it and default to 0 on the last floor) rather than just
//    trusting the unused value stays harmless - reproduces upstream's real
//    behavior exactly (the value is never examined either way) without
//    ever touching memory outside the array.
//
// Everything else was checked and confirmed correct, not just skipped:
// every remaining data table (`osoCharPattern`/`osoAsciiPattern`/
// `osoRndNumbers`/all 8 stages' `osoStageStart`/`BlockCount`/`EnemyCount`/
// `Blocks`/`Enemies`/`Bytes`/every other melody table) byte-diffed clean
// against a fresh extraction from the real upstream source; every
// `#define` constant cross-checked against `Chars.h`/`Movable.h`/
// `Stage.h`/`Block.h`/`Sprite.h`/`Stages.h`'s own real values; the whole
// `osoComposeRawByte()`/`osoRender()` pipeline traced against
// `VVramToVram()`/`DrawSprites()`/`DrawBackground()` line by line
// (including the genuine 1-row vertical crop and the VVramHeight=18
// headroom, both already correctly reproduced); `Oled.cpp`'s own
// `RightToLeft`/`BottomToTop` commands confirmed present (no additional
// software orientation transform needed, matching Cracky's own already-
// settled finding); the entire `osoMoveMan()`/`osoDecideDirection()`/
// `osoPushBlock()`/`osoUpdateBlocks()`/`osoMoveBlocksOnce()` state
// machine traced against `Man.cpp`/`Monster.cpp`/`Block.cpp` including
// the "goto stop" facing-without-moving branch, the block destroy-vs-
// slide-vs-fall decision tree, and the full state-machine timing
// (`osoNoteFrames`, `WaitTimer(8/CoordRate)`, the two-`MoveBlocks()`-
// calls-per-tick simplification already documented above); every
// `ScanKeys.cpp` direction mapping and `Timer.cpp`'s real 60Hz tick rate
// (confirming `OSO_TICK_DIVISOR=8` matches `WaitTimer(8/CoordRate)`
// exactly).
//
// Verified live, not just by code reading, via this project's own
// Puppeteer/WebGL test harness (a fully isolated WebBuild copy + a unique
// local port, to avoid clobbering other concurrently-running verification
// agents' own test instances): the corrected title screen (OSOTOS/STAGE/
// >START/TIME/CONTINU all render cleanly with no overlap, confirming fix
// #1); a full playthrough of stage 1's own gameplay (floors, ladders,
// items, blocks, and monsters all render correctly; TIME visibly
// decrementing at the correct rate; a real death-and-retry cycle
// correctly recomputing a fresh, correct `StageTime` - 88, confirmed by
// hand-deriving the exact formula from stage 0's own real item count - and
// correctly preserving `Score` across that retry, exactly matching
// upstream's real `try_:` vs. `Score=0` reset scope); the block-push
// mechanic (pushing a block toward a wall/edge visibly starts its
// destroy-animation sequence); and, directly confirming the coordinator's
// own specific concern about the score-printing declaration-order history,
// a real block-vs-monster kill - the "10"-point bonus sprite appeared at
// the kill site and `SCORE` visibly updated from "00" to "100" (upstream's
// own `PrintScore()` always appends a decorative trailing '0' after the
// real 5-digit value, so "100" here means a real score of 10, matching
// `Values[0]` for a fresh, uncombo'd kill exactly) - end-to-end proof the
// whole `osoStartPoint()` -> `osoAddScoreForward()` -> `osoPrintScore()`
// chain works correctly in the actual running game, not just on paper.
// Not independently forced this pass: reaching an item pickup directly (a
// short BFS-based reachability check confirmed stage 1's own nearest items
// need at least one block cleared out of the way first, a real Sokoban-
// style puzzle rather than a simple walk - a monster kill was reached
// first and used as the score-verification vehicle instead), a full
// stage-clear/bonus-tally sequence, and the game-over-after-3-lives path -
// all three reuse state machinery already exercised by the death/retry
// cycle and the bonus-countdown code already traced above, so risk is low,
// but worth a direct check if anything looks off.

// crkMelodyBgm2 (this file's header comment used to claim BGM2 "matches
// Cracky's own... BGM2 tables byte-for-byte", which turned out to be
// true only for BGM1 - BGM2 is a genuinely different, one-octave-higher
// bassline in OSOTOS's own real source: C4/E4/G4/A3/D4/F3/G3/B3, not
// Cracky's own C3/E3/G3/A2/D3/F2/G2/B2). Every raw numeric pitch literal
// below (9,13,16,6,11,14,18,4,8,2 - Cracky's own octave-3 scale values)
// was exactly 12 semitones (one octave) below the correct OSOTOS value -
// the whole BGM2 voice played a full octave too low for the entire game.
// Fixed by rewriting the table from OSOTOS's own real notes2[] directly,
// using named mnemonics (matching this file's own BGM1 table's style)
// instead of raw numbers, so a future octave slip like this is far
// easier to catch by eye.
