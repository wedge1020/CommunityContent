// =============================================================================
// MIEYEN mini (inufuto, UIAPduino+SSD1306 edition, "License: None specified" -
// GitHub reports no LICENSE file for `UIAPduino_mieyen`) - a maze/hunting
// game: walk a 8x5 grid maze dropping breadcrumbs (dots) behind you, shoot
// the INVISIBLE monsters roaming the maze before they steal every hamburger
// (food) or touch you. The monsters only ever flash visible for a moment -
// when they eat one of your dropped breadcrumbs (silently, no flash), when
// they steal a hamburger (a flash + a "stolen" jingle), when they touch you,
// or while they're playing their multi-step death animation after being
// shot - the rest of the time they're rendered with no sprite at all. Since
// a breadcrumb only ever gets dropped once (on a cell with no existing dot/
// food) and a monster silently erases it in passing, watching which crumbs
// vanish over time is the *only* way to infer an invisible monster's own
// past path (matches the readme.md's own description almost exactly:
// "defeat every invisible monster to clear; the breadcrumbs a monster eats
// disappear, so you can infer its position; losing every hamburger or
// touching a monster ends the game"). 8 hand-authored mazes, 3 lives, real
// persistent hi-score tracked in-session (same CH32V003/RISC-V-not-AVR
// situation as this project's own Cracky port - no EEPROM/avrCompat concerns
// here at all).
//
// Ported directly following `src/games/gameCracky.c`'s own already-proven
// methodology (same author/engine lineage - `Vram.cpp`/`VVram.cpp`/
// `Oled.cpp`/`ScanKeys.cpp`/`Timer.cpp` are all confirmed BYTE-FOR-BYTE
// identical to Cracky's own copies via a direct `diff`, only `Sound.cpp`'s
// Tempo/melodies/`Point.cpp`/`Fire.cpp`/`Chars.cpp`/`Stage.cpp`/`Stages.cpp`
// genuinely differ) - reusing every technique that port already proved out,
// not re-deriving them from scratch.
//
// **No hardware display-orientation transform is applied, matching Cracky's
// own final, user-verified conclusion** - `InitOled()`'s `SegRemap`/
// `ComScanDec` register writes exist to compensate for a real physical
// panel-mounting quirk on the ACTUAL hardware, with nothing analogous to
// correct for in a software recreation. `miyComposeRawByte(col,page)` is
// drawn directly at its own `(col,page)` - no column mirror, no page
// reorder, no bit-reversal, no lookup table.
//
// **Rendering reuses the identical two-level VVram/CharPattern tile system
// Cracky's own header comment already derived in full** - `VVramToVram()`/
// `SendUL()`'s exact nibble-interleave (`(upper&0xf)|(lower<<4)` /
// `(upper>>4)|(lower&0xf0)`), `AsciiPattern`'s own 27-character table (byte-
// diff confirmed identical to Cracky's own copy), and the status-text-area
// split at raw column 96 (`VVramWidth*4`) - all reused verbatim as
// `miyComposeRawByte()`. Unlike Cracky's own `int[16][24] crkVVram` (a real
// 2D array, since Cracky's own `MapToVVram()` only ever used explicit x/y
// loops), Mieyen's own `Stage.cpp` genuinely relies on raw pointer-walking
// arithmetic for its wall-drawing pass (`pVVram += 2`, `pVVram += VVramWidth
// * 3 - ColumnWidth * ColumnCount`, etc) - reproducing that arithmetic
// faithfully was far lower-risk than re-deriving an equivalent nested-loop
// form by hand, so this port uses a genuinely FLAT `int[VVramWidth*
// VVramHeight]` array (`miyVVramBack`/`miyVVramFront`) with an explicit
// `miyVVramIdx(x,y)` helper, matching upstream's own real flat-array layout
// even more literally than Cracky's simplification did - `miyVPut`/
// `miyVPut2C`/`miyVErase2` are direct 1:1 ports of `VPut`/`VPut2C`/
// `VErase2`, taking an explicit `int*` buffer parameter since sometimes the
// target is the persistent "map" layer (`miyVVramBack`, written by
// `miySetCell`/the wall-drawing pass) and sometimes the per-frame composite
// (`miyVVramFront`, written by `miyDrawSprites`/`miyDrawPoints`) - matching
// upstream's own real Back-vs-Front distinction, which this port's
// `miyDrawAll()` (`VVramBackToFront + DrawSprites + DrawPoints`) preserves
// exactly rather than collapsing into one buffer.
//
// **The `GAME OVER` message reuses Cracky's own already-solved overlay
// technique** (`miyOverlayActive`/`miyOverlayText`/`miyOverlayPage`/
// `miyOverlayCol`) - `PrintGameOver()` writes its text directly into real
// Vram bytes bypassing VVram entirely, which persists on real hardware only
// because nothing else re-touches those exact bytes; since this port always
// redraws the full frame from VVram every tick, a literal port would make
// the message flash for one frame and vanish.
//
// **The title screen's own text was originally, wrongly, confined to the
// same narrow 8-column status grid SCORE/STAGE/etc use - fixed after a real
// user-supplied hardware photo of Cracky's own title screen proved this
// whole narrow-grid model was wrong for the entire family of Cate-engine
// ports, not just Cracky.** Upstream's real Vram address space is a
// genuinely wide 32-char-cell-per-page canvas - the status labels occupy
// only columns 24-31 (`Status.cpp`'s own `LeftX=24`), and the title
// screen's own "INUFUTO 2026"/"START"/"CONTINUE" text sits at columns 8-23,
// well clear of them, using the exact same shared `PrintC()`/`PrintS()`
// mechanism at different column arguments - not a separate, narrower grid
// at all. `miyStatusChar` was widened from `[8][8]` to `[8][32]` to match,
// with a new `miyFullWidthText` flag (true only on the title screen) making
// `miyComposeRawByte()` render the whole canvas from it instead of just the
// narrow status zone - see both symbols' own header comments, and
// `miyBeginTitle()`'s own header comment for the specific bug this
// previously caused (a truncated "CONTINUE"/dropped "INUFUTO 2026" credit,
// now both restored at their real upstream columns).
//
// **The title screen's own real dithered logo bitmap (`TitleBytes[]`,
// `miyTitleBytes` here) is now drawn for real, matching Cracky's own fix.**
// An earlier pass here had simplified it to plain small text ("MIEYEN" via
// the 8-column AsciiPattern font) and separately, wrongly, believed
// upstream's own Mieyen `Title()` has no "MINI" subtitle line at all - both
// mistakes, corrected the same way Cracky's identical mistakes were: see
// `miyBeginTitle()`'s own header comment for the full story, and
// `miyComposeRawByte()`'s own header for the OR-combine fix that actually
// lets the logo reach the screen (the earlier version's `miyFullWidthText`
// branch took over unconditionally during the title screen, so the logo
// bitmap in `miyVVramFront` was never even read while the title screen was
// showing, regardless of what was written there).
//
// **A genuinely different, more elaborate movement/AI model than Cracky's
// own floor-and-ladder platforming** - a real 8x5 walled maze grid (`Stage.h`'s
// own per-cell `Cell_RightWall`/`Cell_BottomWall` bits, not floors/ladders),
// with the man/monsters/fire bullets all sharing ONE combined
// `struct MiyMovable` (x, y, sprite, status, dx, dy, targetX, targetY, time -
// every field ANY of the three flavors ever needs), matching this project's
// own established "flatten every flavor into one struct + explicit-pointer
// functions" precedent (Tiny Plaque's own `TplaqSprite`) rather than the
// separate-but-compatible-layout inheritance upstream's C++ uses (`struct
// Monster : Movable {...}`, `struct Fire : Movable {...}`). `ShowMovable()`
// (shared by BOTH Man and Monster upstream, a single generic direction-
// pattern-cycling function - simpler than Cracky's own bespoke per-object
// `crkShowMan`/`crkShowMonster`) is reproduced as `miyShowMovable()`.
//
// **A genuinely reachable out-of-bounds VVram write, found and fixed by
// inspection before ever compiling, not by a crash**: `DrawPoints()`
// upstream has NO bounds checking at all (unlike `DrawSprites()`, which
// checks `x < VVramWidth`/`y < VVramHeight` per cell) - its 3-cell-wide
// score-popup strip is placed directly at a just-hit monster's own real X
// coordinate, which can legitimately reach 24 (`ToCoord(7)+2`, the far edge
// of the last grid column) - `24+2=26`, past the real 24-wide VVram row,
// a genuine out-of-bounds array write on this platform (harmless-on-real-
// hardware adjacent-memory scribbling upstream, a real correctness/safety
// concern here). Fixed by clamping the popup's own X in `miyStartPoint()`
// to `MIY_VVRAM_WIDTH-3` (21) - the popup shifts up to 3 cells left of the
// hit position only in this rare far-right-edge case, never silently
// corrupts memory.
//
// **The same signed-`byte`-minus-1-then-compared-unsigned safety concern
// already documented in `ShowSprite()`'s own upstream comment** (`pSprite->x
// = pMovable->x - 1;`, only ever compared against an upper bound
// `x<VVramWidth` on real hardware, where a genuinely-zero `pMovable->x`
// would wrap to 255 and safely fail that same check) - proven, by tracing
// every reachable coordinate through `CanMove()`'s own boundary guards, that
// `pMovable->x` can never actually be 0 for any of Man/Monster/Fire (column0's
// own left-wall check blocks leaving x=1, the minimum grid coordinate) -
// but ported with an explicit `x>=0` lower-bound guard in `miyDrawSprites()`
// anyway (a real, if never-actually-triggered, second half of the same
// bounds check DrawSprites() already needs on this platform, matching this
// project's own standing "guard the crash even if unreachable in practice"
// discipline for this exact bug family), since Vircon32's non-truncating
// `int` can't rely on the same accidental wraparound-then-fail-the-upper-
// bound-check safety net a real AVR `byte` gets for free.
//
// **Two genuinely dead, always-true "throttle" checks, both sharing the
// same root cause, simplified away rather than ported literally** (re-
// verified during a later full audit pass - see that section further down
// for the full re-check story - and corrected here from an earlier, less
// precise claim of "three" places): two separate places in upstream
// (`Monster.cpp`'s own `MoveMonsters()`, `Fire.cpp`'s own `MoveFires()`)
// each gate a small piece of logic behind
// `if ((someLocalStaticClock & CoordMask) == 0)` - but
// `CoordMask = CoordRate-1 = (1<<CoordShift)-1 = 0` here (`CoordShift=0`,
// the same degenerate case Cracky's own `CRK_COORD_MASK` already
// documented), so `anything & 0 == 0` is unconditionally true regardless of
// the clock's own value - both of these local statics are confirmed, by
// direct inspection, to have NO other reader anywhere in their own function
// (write-only otherwise), making both genuinely dead weight rather than
// real gating logic. Dropped entirely; the guarded code now runs
// unconditionally every call, matching the real, always-true upstream
// outcome exactly. (`Man.cpp`'s own `MoveMan()` has a *third*, superficially
// similar-looking `(clock & CoordMask) == 0` check, but it sits inside a
// block that's entirely `//`-commented-out in the real upstream source
// itself - dead code on paper, not merely dead-at-runtime - so there was
// never anything there to port at all; the port's own omission of it is
// correct regardless, this is purely a documentation-precision fix.)
// `Man.cpp`'s own fire-repeat cooldown counter
// (`keyCount`, ported as the persistent global `miyManKeyCount`) is the one
// local static that IS load-bearing - and, matching its real C++
// function-local-static lifetime (zero-initialized once at program start,
// never explicitly reset anywhere else in the whole program, not even
// between stages/retries), it is likewise never reset anywhere in this
// port either (relying on Vircon32's own zero-initialized globals to match
// that same "set once, at the very beginning" semantic) - a deliberate
// case of *not* resetting something, the mirror image of this project's
// more commonly-documented "audit every non-zero static initializer" bug
// class.
//
// **A real, easy-to-miss dual-timing-rate mechanic, faithfully
// reproduced**: upstream's own play loop has exactly ONE genuine real-time
// throttle (`WaitTimer(8/CoordRate)`, inside the `Clock%4==0` branch that
// also runs `MoveMan()`/`DrawAll()`) - but `MoveFires()` is called
// completely UNCONDITIONALLY on every one of the 4 raw loop iterations per
// "big tick" (the `WaitTimer`-gated period), while `MoveMonsters()` only
// runs on every OTHER big tick (`Clock%8==0`, half as often as `MoveMan()`).
// Net effect: fire bullets travel visibly 4x faster than the player/
// monsters between rendered frames, since 3 of their 4 movement steps per
// big tick happen "invisibly" in between renders with no real-time pause
// between them. Reproduced in `miyUpdatePlaying()` by calling
// `miyMoveFires()` 4 times per gated tick (3 "leftover" calls from the
// tail of the *previous* big tick's own off-ticks, matching their real
// chronological position *before* that tick's own `MoveMan`/`MoveMonsters`,
// then 1 final call after) rather than approximating with a flat "fire is
// just faster" rate - preserves the *exact* interleaving upstream has
// between `MoveMonsters()` and the fire-bullet steps around it. The very
// first big tick after entering PLAYING correctly skips the "3 leftover"
// calls (there is no previous big tick to have left any over), matching
// `Clock`'s own real value of exactly 0 at that point.
//
// **`Sound.cpp` is the same 3-tone-channel tracker as Cracky's own copy,
// just with `Tempo=180` instead of 160 and this game's own melodies** -
// `SoundHandler()`'s own real tempo math re-derived the same way Cracky's
// header comment already explains: a channel advances once every
// `(600/2)/Tempo = 1.667` real 60Hz ticks, giving
// `miyNoteFrames(length) = round(length * 5.0/3.0)`. Reused the identical
// 3-slot sequencer shape (0=one-shot SFX - `Fire`/`Hit`/`Stole`/`Loose`/
// `Bonus` all share it, since none of them ever overlaps another in time;
// 1=jingle/BGM-voice-A; 2=BGM-voice-B), all data byte-diff-extracted via a
// small Python script rather than hand-copied. `Sound_Bonus()`'s own real
// `WaitMelody()` (block until the whole 6-note melody finishes, THEN wait
// 30 more real ticks) needed a genuine 2-phase wait state
// (`miyBonusPlayingSound` then `miyBonusExtraWait`) in `miyUpdateBonusTally()`
// rather than Cracky's own simpler fixed-frame-count approximation (which
// only needed to represent a single note) - dynamically polling
// `!miySeqPlaying(0)` matches `WaitMelody`'s real "wait until actually
// done" semantic exactly regardless of how the 6-note melody's own data
// might change in the future.
//
// **Two real, deliberately-preserved upstream oddities, not "fixed"**:
// (1) `Monster.cpp`'s own `DecideDirection()` has the exact same class of
// cross-axis comparison bug Cracky's own `crkDecideDirection` already found
// and documented (`crkMan.x < pMonster->y` there; here,
// `pMonster->targetX <= pMonster->y`, comparing an X value against a Y
// field) - almost certainly propagated from the same shared Cate-engine
// boilerplate this author (inufuto) reuses across both games. Kept exactly
// as written. (2) The Loose-monster "dying" animation timing genuinely
// varies by 1-4 ticks depending on which direction the monster was facing
// when hit (`status += 2` on a byte whose low 3 bits already only ever
// hold 0/2/4/6, checked against `(status&7)==0` - reaches that condition
// after 4/3/2/1 increments respectively) - reproduced with plain `int`
// arithmetic (no AVR-byte-overflow reliance needed at all here, since the
// counter never needs to exceed 8 before the monster is removed and its
// slot reset).
//
// **Data**: `AsciiPattern`/`Frequencies` reused verbatim (byte-diff
// confirmed identical to Cracky's own already-extracted copies of the same
// shared tables); `CharPattern` (118 glyphs, this game's own wall/fence/
// point/man/monster/fire/dot/food art), all 8 stages' `start`/`enemyCount`/
// `enemies[4]`/`bytes[20]`, and all 9 melodies (`Loose`/`Fire`/`Hit`/
// `Stole`/`Bonus`/`Start`/`Clear`/`GameOver`/`Bgm1`/`Bgm2`) were all
// extracted via a small Python script and byte-diff-verified against the
// real upstream source before ever being pasted in, matching this
// project's own established anti-transcription-bug discipline.
//
// **A full post-registration verification pass** (this game was ported in
// a large parallel batch by a different session, which already needed two
// central fixes - two missing note-frequency `#define`s and an `int
// name[N]` vs `int[N] name` array-declaration mistake - flagging it as a
// higher-risk candidate worth a dedicated re-audit): re-traced every
// upstream `.cpp`/`.h` file in `more games/UIAPduino_mieyen/` line-by-line
// against this port (rendering compositing, movement/collision, the whole
// state machine, the sound sequencer, and every data table) and confirmed
// it all matches, with one real, confirmed exception:
//
// **A genuine rendering bug, originally found via live Puppeteer testing,
// then later found to be a symptom of a much bigger, project-wide
// mismodeling rather than a one-off overflow** - `miyBeginTitle()`'s own
// "CONTINUE" menu label originally tried to print 8 characters starting at
// column 1 of an (incorrectly) 8-wide status-char grid, one column past
// its own real 0-7 range; the out-of-range write to `[6][8]` silently
// aliased onto `[7][0]` (`int[8][8]` being flat row-major, `6*8+8 ==
// 7*8+0 == 56`), corrupting the "remain lives" digit slot with a stray 'E'
// and splicing it in front of the credit line, while row 6 itself only
// ever showed "CONTINU". That was first patched around by abbreviating the
// label to "CONT" - but a later, real user-supplied hardware photo of
// Cracky's own title screen proved the actual root cause was the grid
// itself being modeled far too narrow in the first place (see
// `miyStatusChar`'s own header comment) - the abbreviation was masking the
// real bug, not fixing it. **Properly fixed** by widening the grid to
// `[8][32]` and moving every title-screen string to its real upstream
// column (see `miyBeginTitle()`'s own header comment) - "CONTINUE" is now
// printed in full, and the "INUFUTO 2026" credit (previously truncated to
// just "INUFUTO" for the same narrow-grid reason) is now printed in full
// too, both with plenty of real room to spare since they sit at columns
// 8-23, nowhere near the status labels' own columns 24-31. A full grep of
// every other `miyPrintS`/`miyPrintC`/`miyPrintByteNumber2`/
// `miyPrintNumber5` call site in the file confirmed every one of them now
// uses a real upstream column, not a leftover local 0-7 offset.
//
// **Everything else checked and confirmed correct, not just skipped**:
// every sprite/tile/font/stage/melody data table re-extracted from the
// real upstream source via a fresh Python script and byte-diffed against
// this file's own copy (all matched, including every note-frequency
// `#define` actually referenced by a melody table - no further missing-
// define gaps of the kind already found once during central registration);
// the monster-invisible-except-when-flashing mechanic (spawn-visible,
// goes invisible on first move, flashes visible again on eating food/
// touching Man/during its own death animation); every CanMove/IsOnGrid/
// IsNear boundary check; the two-phase Bonus-tally wait; the exact
// interleaving of the 4-times-faster fire-bullet movement around
// MoveMan/MoveMonsters (see above); the FoodCount==0-triggers-a-30-tick-
// wait-before-dying vs. Man-touched-dies-immediately asymmetry (a real,
// easy-to-miss difference in upstream's own control flow, preserved
// correctly by `miyBeginLoseWait()` vs. `miyBeginLose()`); and the
// `UpdateMonsterTargets()` food-target scan's own cross-monster carried-
// over scan position (column/row/cell persist *across* monsters within one
// call, not reset per-monster - confirmed both upstream and the port keep
// this as a set of plain locals shared across the whole loop). Live-tested
// via an isolated Puppeteer/WebGL instance through a complete play
// session: menu registration/title screen (bug found and fixed above),
// the ~4-second blocking start jingle correctly withholding all player
// input until it finishes (matching upstream's real blocking
// `Sound_Start()`), movement in all 4 directions, firing (a visible flame/
// bullet sprite), the exact stage-0 food positions (col4,row2 / col0,row3
// / col6,row4 - independently verified against the real maze data,
// confirming the "3" food-count digit and the two monster-spawn sprites
// at the maze's own top corners, col0,row0 / col7,row0, were both
// correctly identified rather than mistaken for each other), monsters
// eating breadcrumbs/hamburgers over time (dots/food disappearing with no
// player interaction), a full man-dies-to-monster-touch -> life-lost ->
// stage-reset cycle (maze/dots/food/monster-visibility all correctly
// restored to their stage-template state), and a complete run through all
// 3 lives ending in a real GAME OVER -> Title transition, correctly
// showing the just-ended game's own stale Score (a real "8" internally,
// legitimately *displayed* as "80" thanks to upstream's own intentional
// trailing decorative zero in `PrintScore()` - not a display bug, already
// traced through the code before ever being seen on screen) and Stage
// values on the title screen until a fresh Start/Continue press, exactly
// matching upstream's own real behavior. No crashes or corruption at any
// point across the whole session.

// in upstream's own (unmirrored) GDDRAM coordinate space - no hardware
// remap is applied anywhere, see header.
//
// **OR-combines mapByte with textByte instead of choosing one exclusively -
// the same fix Cracky's own crkComposeRawByte() needed for the identical
// reason.** The original version below only ever fell into the VVram/map
// branch when `!miyFullWidthText` - meaning while on the title screen
// (`miyFullWidthText == true`), this function's `else` branch took over
// UNCONDITIONALLY for every column, including the ones inside the map area
// (rawCol < MIY_VVRAM_WIDTH*4) where the real bitmap logo (see
// miyBeginTitle()) is drawn into miyVVramFront - so that logo could never
// actually reach the screen no matter what was written into miyVVramFront,
// since composeRawByte() never even looked there while the title screen was
// showing. Now mapByte is always computed whenever rawCol is in the map
// range (matching Cracky exactly), and textByte is always computed from
// miyStatusChar - safe to OR together because the two occupy disjoint real
// hardware pages by construction: the logo bitmap only ever occupies pages
// 1-2 (miyBeginTitle() writes it at VVram rows 2-5), while every piece of
// title-screen status text (SCORE/STAGE/MINI/START/CONTINUE/credit) lives on
// pages 0/3/5/6/7 - and during normal gameplay, miyStatusChar is never
// written at charCol < 24 at all (miyPrintStatus()'s own real columns start
// at upstream's `LeftX=24`), so textByte for the map area is always 0 there,
// making mapByte|textByte == mapByte outside the title screen exactly as

// **Rewritten after the same real user-supplied hardware photo that

// `crkBeginTitle()` header comment) proved this function's previous
// version was making the identical mistake.** The earlier version believed
// upstream's own title-screen text ("CONTINUE", the "INUFUTO 2026" credit)
// collided with the SCORE/STAGE/FOOD/remain status labels and had to be
// trimmed/dropped to fit - "CONTINUE" was truncated to "CONT" and the
// credit line's own " 2026" was dropped outright, keeping only "INUFUTO".
// Re-reading upstream's real `Status.cpp` (`Title()`) line by line shows
// this diagnosis was backwards: none of that text ever collides with
// anything upstream, because upstream's own Vram address space is a
// genuinely wide 32-char-cell-per-page canvas (see miyStatusChar's own
// header comment) - the status labels occupy only columns 24-31
// (upstream's own `LeftX=24`), and every piece of title-screen text sits
// at columns 8-23, well clear of them. The ROOT problem was this port's
// own `miyStatusChar` being modeled as an 8-column-wide grid in the first
// place - now fixed there, this function is rewritten to place everything
// at upstream's real, literal columns, with `miyFullWidthText=true` so
// miyComposeRawByte() renders the full canvas instead of just the narrow
