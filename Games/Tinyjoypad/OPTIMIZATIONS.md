# Per-game optimizations

Vircon32's budget is a hard 250,000 CPU cycles/frame - if a frame's work
doesn't finish inside that, the engine just stops mid-instruction-stream
until the next frame. Most fixes below share one of two shapes:
**per-pixel work that didn't need to run every pixel** (composite sprites
once per row/object into a buffer instead of re-scanning per pixel), or
**a self-gated function that still costs a full call every time it's
invoked** (gate the *call site* too, not just the function body). Full
details/measurements are in `CLAUDE.md`; this is just the summary.

- **NumberPlace / 2048 / HollowSeeker** - obonoCoreShim's own shared
  `drawSprites()` already composites per page row, not per pixel - no
  extra work needed.
- **Tiny Invaders** - row-gated 5 UI layers to their real footprint;
  cached the monster-grid cell lookup per ~14px cell instead of
  recomputing every pixel; call-site-gated monster/shot draws to their
  own known row/column range.
- **Tiny Pacman / Tiny Bomber** - replaced per-pixel sprite re-scan with
  per-page-row compositing into a shared buffer; O(1) bit-index math
  instead of a repeated-subtraction loop for block/dot bitmaps.
- **Tiny Doc** - row/x-range gating; per-row sprite compositing; skip a
  virus-overlay blit that was provably always zero; row-scoped dirty-flag
  cache for the locked-grid layer (only recompute rows that changed).
- **Tiny Bert** - per-object-per-page sprite compositing from the start;
  later added plate-grid dirty-flag caching + attract-screen gating.
  Baseline stayed ~70-76% either way - dominant cost is sheer draw-call
  volume from dense background art, not compositing logic.
- **Tiny Tris** - grid/piece/preview composited per row from the start;
  attract screen only redraws on the exact frame its content changes
  (whole-screen dirty flag) instead of every frame.
- **Tiny Arkanoid** - decoupled logic-tick rate from redraw rate (fixed
  an ~8x speed bug); call-site row/x-gated all 6 render layers.
- **Tiny Trick** - sprite compositing from the start; frozen-frame cache
  during the multi-second goal-scored sequence (recompute once, reuse for
  every held frame); inlined a 1024x/frame background-mirror lookup.
- **Tiny Missile** - two-round fix: per-page-row compositing for all
  sprite layers, then analytic (not scanned) per-row trail-column range
  for missile trails.
- **Tiny Bike** - per-object footprint gating for the player sprite and
  the obstacle map compositor.
- **Tiny Arena** (raycaster) - precomputed per-row texture lookups and
  cached per-run column classification for sprite scaling; inlined a
  tiny but extremely hot (~3200 calls/frame) helper; downsampled a
  ~217-call synchronous death-sound sweep to a frame-stepped one.
- **Tiny Pipe** - per-row sprite compositing (player + turtles).
- **Tiny Morpion** - call-site-gated 3 menu sprites to their exact known
  footprint; removed a score-digit call that was provably always zero.
- **Tiny Plaque** - removed a stray unconditional full-screen redraw call
  left over from porting (upstream only redraws 1-in-6 ticks); per-row
  food-sprite compositing; call-site gating for score/tube overlays.
- **Tiny SQuest** - per-row compositing for enemies and main/sub/
  ballistic sprites.
- **Tiny DDug** - call-site gating for the player sprite and score;
  per-row cache for tunnel-wall reads instead of two lookups per pixel.
- **Tiny Lander** - split the render loop on the fixed instrument-panel
  vs. game-area boundary (these never overlap), then row-gated each
  individual dashboard layer to its own single matching row.
- **Wren Rollercoaster** - every text/number layer row-gated to its real
  footprint from the start (no retrofit needed).
- **Frogger** - bounded an unbounded dock-scan loop; cached a per-column
  digit-count recompute.
- **Bat Bonanza (Pong)** - hoisted a per-pixel division out of the render
  loop; cached `strlen()` per row instead of per pixel on the attract
  screen.
- **Stacker** - cached the score's digit count once per frame instead of
  recomputing it on every HUD pixel.
- **UFO** - per-page compositing for the obstacle list and star field;
  cached score digit count.
- **Tiny Dungeon** - the deepest optimization pass in the project, five
  rounds: (1) hoisted wall/object visibility checks out of the per-column
  loop into a once-per-frame precompute pass; (2) replaced full 24/99-
  entry scans with compact lists of only the actually-visible entries;
  (3) computed per-object scan constants once per column instead of once
  per row/mask-vs-bitmap call; (4) row-range-gated the sprite scaler to
  each object's real vertical extent (as narrow as 2 of 8 rows); (5)
  merged the separate mask/bitmap scans into one pass and resolved each
  sprite's bitmap array via a runtime pointer instead of a per-byte
  dispatch chain. Fixed real frame truncation and dropped an idle scene
  from a saturated 100% to 85%; a close-up sprite view can still spike to
  100% - the remaining cost would need a bigger rendering-model change
  (pre-render each sprite once per frame instead of per-column scanning).
- **Oroboros** - none needed. Plain grid-cell lookups only (no sprite
  bitmaps, no font-dispatch chains) - the simplest render model of any
  port in this project, measured at a steady ~50-56% CPU with no
  optimization pass required.
- **Run Dude Run** - two rounds, both found via the user reporting CPU hit
  100% once score passed 1000 (the point `rddTotalBombs` starts climbing
  toward its 16-bomb cap with no ceiling check). Round 1: composited all
  live bombs into a shared per-page buffer instead of rescanning all 16
  at every one of 1024 pixels/frame (up to 16,384 checks/frame down to a
  few hundred). Measured with a temporary debug hook forcing 16 bombs:
  CPU was *still* pegged near 100% after round 1 - round 2 found why:
  each bomb byte was resolved via an 8-bit-scan loop calling a second
  function per bit (up to ~2,000 nested function calls/frame at 16
  bombs) - replaced with a single sign-branched shift of the sprite's
  16-bit column value (top+bottom byte combined), no inner loop or
  nested call at all. Confirmed via the perf overlay: 16 bombs live
  dropped from pegged/near-100% to a steady ~52-63%, correct rendering
  verified via screenshot throughout both rounds.
- **Four in a Row** - none needed for rendering (a simple board of static
  glyph lookups, no sprite/object scanning). The AI's own minimax-ish
  lookahead was spread across real frames *proactively*, before ever
  shipping, once a back-of-envelope estimate suggested a single-frame
  synchronous evaluation risked exceeding the cycle budget - one column
  (20 rollout scans) per frame measured pegged CPU at 100% for ~2 frames
  per column, so narrowed further to one rollout scan per frame (worst
  case 140 real frames total, ~2.3s - still a reasonable "thinking"
  pause), landing at a steady ~53% with zero risk of frame truncation.
- **Dino Game** - one proactive fix, applied before ever shipping and
  verified via code inspection only (per direct instruction not to test
  it): the cactus layer had the classic O(pixels x objects) shape (128
  columns x 6 cactuses = up to 768 checks/frame). Composited into a
  shared per-frame page buffer instead (cuts it to ~48 iterations), the
  same lesson applied throughout this project. The dino sprite itself and
  the ground/rock layer were already call-site-gated/cheap from the
  start, needing no further change.
- **SnakeGame85** - one fix, a direct consequence of a display-
  orientation bug fix (real hardware runs this game column/row-reversed
  and bit-reversed - see CLAUDE.md): the bit-reversal was first done as
  an 8-iteration shift/or loop for every one of 1024 pixels/frame (8192
  total), pushing a real frame over budget (visible as partial-frame
  truncation). Replaced with a precomputed 256-entry lookup table (every
  byte's own reversal is a pure function of its 8-bit value, the same
  "bake all 256 byte values into a table" approach the column atlas
  itself already uses) - CPU dropped to a steady ~5-6%.
- **Jump Slime** - the current stage's 12-13 blocks were rescanned from
  inside the per-pixel render call, and player/coin/enemy sprites were
  handed to the sprite blitter across all 128 columns regardless of
  their real ~8px footprint. Fixed with two per-page composite buffers
  (blocks read directly since they're always page-aligned; sprites still
  call the blitter but only across their own real column span) - dropped
  from a pegged, frame-truncating 100% to a steady 60%.
- **TinyRoG** - the map-tile renderer was called once per pixel even
  though 8 consecutive columns always belong to the same tile (a
  redundant-lookup waste, not the O(pixels x objects) shape). A first
  attempt added a per-tile cache but measured *no* improvement, since the
  call itself (not the lookup) was the cost - fixed properly by
  compositing each page row by walking tiles (at most 17/row) instead of
  pixels (128/row) into a shared buffer. Dropped from a pegged 100% to a
  steady 60%.
- **TinY Fi** - already composited per-character into a per-page buffer
  from the start, but that composite still called the generic per-column
  sprite blitter once per column per layer per character (up to ~20 x 5
  x 4 = 400 calls/page), each redundantly recomputing the same per-row
  constants. Fixed by hoisting that computation to run once per
  (character, layer, page) instead of once per column; the same lesson
  was then applied to the HUD row too. Dropped from a saturated,
  frame-truncating 100% to a steady 50-54%.
- **Breakout** - none needed. Measured 39% CPU during gameplay, 66% on
  the attract screen - both comfortably under budget as shipped.
- **Space Attack** - the alien-fire render check queried every one of
  1024 pixels/frame individually, including a 5-slot fire-position scan
  per pixel. Composited into a shared per-page row buffer instead,
  touching only each feature's own real column range - dropped from
  93-98% to a steady 44%.
- **Falling Blocks** - two layers needed fixing: the per-cell game-grid
  renderer recomputed the same block/ghost-cell lookup up to 6 times in
  a row (one board row spans 6 physical columns), and the attract
  screen's fixed title text/credits were called unconditionally across
  all 1024 pixels/frame despite each only ever being nonzero within a
  narrow known footprint. Fixed with a per-row composite buffer for the
  game grid and call-site gating (a literal duplicate of each callee's
  own bounds check) for the attract-screen text. Attract screen dropped
  from a pegged 100% to 5-6%, gameplay from a pegged 100% (with a
  visibly truncated frame) to a steady 5-9%.
- **Tiny Mania** - the largest optimization pass in the project after
  Tiny Dungeon's, several rounds: (1) replaced 286 individual
  `drawSprite2Bit()` calls drawing the attract screen's own solid border
  lines one pixel-column at a time with direct buffer writes (100% ->
  46%); (2) replaced an O(cells x ghosts) per-cell ghost scan (up to
  1176 redundant comparisons/frame) with a per-frame O(ghosts) bucket-
  linked-list index; (3) a specialized blitter for the shared w=9,h=7
  sprite shape (walls/dots), skipping the generic blitter's own frame/
  plane-size arithmetic; (4) a 30fps whole-tick throttle (halves average
  load, though not the peak cost of frames that still run full logic -
  see CLAUDE.md for why that distinction matters), with sound
  sequencing specifically rescaled to keep its own real-time pace
  despite the halved tick rate; (5) a wall-column batched writer (7
  bit-by-bit writes collapsed to <=4 masked read-modify-writes) - a
  first attempt shipped a real bug (reversed shift direction, found via
  direct user report), fixed by re-deriving the bit math from scratch
  and validating it against 20,000 randomized test cases before
  re-shipping; (6) a dirty-flag cache for the score/lives HUD row,
  only recomputed when the underlying values actually change. Full
  story, including two further correctness bugs found via user reports
  during this same pass (an instant-game-over state-machine bug, and a
  62-note sound sequence stretched to 13.6x its real duration), in
  CLAUDE.md.
- **Blocks Gold** - none needed. Built on the same per-page composite
  rendering technique already proven in the sibling Falling Blocks (both
  share the same underlying engine), so it was efficient from the start:
  measured 64% CPU on the attract screen, 55% during dense gameplay -
  both comfortably under budget. The one real fix in this port wasn't a
  CPU issue at all: the title-screen melody genuinely blocked gameplay
  start for ~12.9-25.8 real seconds (traced directly to upstream's own
  per-note duration values, not a porting artifact) - scaled down 0.3x
  (pitch unchanged) rather than downsampled by skipping notes, since it's
  a real composed tune worth keeping intact rather than a computed sweep.
  See CLAUDE.md for the full story.
- **Astro Barrier** - the render loop called `barrBulletByte()`/
  `barrTargetByte()` (the latter 3x, once per target) unconditionally for
  every one of 1024 pixels/frame, each a full function call with its own
  struct-pointer dereference - levels with a 32x32 large target or
  multiple simultaneous targets paid this worst, matching a direct user
  report of certain levels hitting 100%. Fixed with a per-page composite
  buffer (the same technique already proven in Falling Blocks/Blocks
  Gold) writing each object - player, bullet, all 3 targets, the bullet-
  count text - directly into a shared row buffer, gated to its own real
  bounding box. Diagnosed and fixed via code inspection only, per direct
  user instruction not to test it in the emulator; the user tested it
  independently afterward and confirmed it was fine. See CLAUDE.md for
  the full story.
- **ATtiny Snake** - the PLAYING-state grid rendering was built with an
  occupancy grid (O(1) per-cell lookup) from the start, so it never had
  the O(pixels x objects) issue - but a direct user question right after
  shipping ("did you optimize it?") prompted a proactive re-check, which
  found the ATTRACT screen's own "S" logo reveal animation *did* have
  it: checking up to 19 revealed trail cells against every one of 1024
  pixels/frame. Fixed the same way, before any user report of it being
  slow: a small occupancy grid mirroring the PLAYING state's own,
  updated once per ~100ms reveal-step instead of rescanned per pixel.
  Measured 20% CPU at rest during play, 28-36% during the attract
  screen's own animation - comfortably under budget both before and
  after the fix.
- **Meteor Storm** - a small, targeted per-digit hoist (compute each
  score digit's decimal value once instead of re-dividing it on every one
  of its own 6 columns) - never measured as a real problem, applied
  proactively on request. Comfortably under budget throughout (19-38%
  CPU). The one real fix in this port wasn't a CPU issue at all: a
  rendering-correctness bug where the border/player/obstacle layers'
  plain-assignment compositing let one layer's own byte write fully
  clobber a different layer's bits sharing the same (column, page)
  address whenever they occupied different real pixel rows within that
  one byte - switched every layer to OR-based compositing instead. See
  CLAUDE.md for the full story, including how it was diagnosed after an
  initial "maybe it's just obstacles" misdiagnosis was directly corrected
  by the user.
- **Flappy Bird** - no optimization needed at all; the simplest rendering
  model in this project (a plain 16x8 grid, fully page/column-aligned, no
  sub-pixel sprite math anywhere) measured 26% CPU during active gameplay
  from the start. The one real fix in this port wasn't a CPU issue either:
  upstream's own real 8-second "grace period" (no collision can register
  at all during a fresh game's first 8 real seconds) was ported faithfully
  at first, then removed entirely after direct user testing showed it
  reads as broken collision detection ("the bird can fly through walls
  without game over happening") rather than a deliberate mercy window.
  See CLAUDE.md for the full diagnostic story, including the deterministic
  tests used to first rule out an actual collision-formula bug.
- **Tiny Bulls And Cows** - no optimization needed; built with per-page
  compositing from the start (the game's own dense, precisely-interleaved
  multi-region UI layout was designed with column ranges confirmed non-
  overlapping before writing any render code). CPU not separately
  measured for this port.
- **ATtiny Tetromino** - built with per-page compositing from the start
  (no O(pixels x objects) shape to retrofit). Measured 43% CPU during
  active gameplay before a later 30fps whole-tick throttle was added (at
  direct user request, to make an already-instant piece-lock-to-next-
  piece transition feel less abrupt - not a CPU fix, see CLAUDE.md).
- **Laser Pong** - built with per-page compositing from the start (every
  sprite - paddle/ball/laser - routed through one shared sub-page byte-
  split helper, the same technique already proven in Meteor Storm/Run
  Dude Run, so no O(pixels x objects) shape ever existed to retrofit).
  Measured 28% CPU during active gameplay via the perf overlay -
  comfortably under budget, no optimization pass needed.
- **Pipe Bird** - built with per-page compositing from the start (the
  bird sprite's own sub-page compositing was already present in upstream's
  own source, just ported directly; the pipe is a plain solid-fill column
  range). No O(pixels x objects) shape existed to retrofit, so CPU was not
  separately measured for this port. The one real fix here wasn't a CPU
  issue either: upstream itself runs at a genuine hardware-timer-driven
  ~30fps, not the "no timing model" category several sibling ports fall
  into - shipping at the engine's native 60fps first ran gravity/pipe
  speed 2x too fast, fixed with a whole-tick 2x throttle at direct user
  request. See CLAUDE.md for the full diagnostic story, including two
  unsigned-integer-wraparound-reliance bugs and a logical-vs-arithmetic-
  shift hazard found and fixed before ever compiling.
